A large stone cistern full to the brim with clean, cold water occupies the western part of the room, whose walls are lined with kegs and barrels.  Aged copper pipes feed from all corners of the room into a single large copper pipe that feeds into the cistern.//

==== 2. Barracks ====
//This appears to be a storeroom pressed into service as living quarters. Two double bunks stand against the north wall, while barrels and crates fill the southern half of the chamber.//

3 [[Redbrands]] are resting in this room.  If it's nighttime, they are asleep.

**Loot**
50 gp (split between the 3)
3 dirty scarlett cloaks hang from the bunks


==== 3. Trapped Halls ====
//Thick dust covers the flagstones of this somber hallway.  The walls are decorated with faux columns every ten feet, and the double doors at the west end of the hall are sheathed in copper plate, now green with age.  A relief carving of a mournful angel graces the doors.//

There is pit trap in center of the hallway with narrow stone ledges along the sides.  DC 15 perception check to notice the trap and ledges.  DC 10 acrobatics to use the ledges.  DC 15 dex save to catch the ledge if falling.

**Developments**
If the trap is triggered, the [[Redbrands]] and skeletons in rooms 2 and 4 respectively come to investigate.


==== 4. Tresendar Crypts ====
//Three large stone sarcophagi stand within this dusty crypt, and propped up against each sarcophagus is a human skeleton clad in bits of rusy mail.  False columns along the walls are carved in the image of spreading oak trees.  The double doors in the southeast corner are sheathed in tarnished copper plate.//

3 skeletons are in this room.  They attack if anybody that isn't wearing a scarlet cloak or speaks the password approaches either of the far doors.

**Developments**
Fighting in this room alerts the [[Redbrands]] in the 5.Slave Pens

**Loot**
3 platinum Tresendar signet rings.  1 is a [[https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/94699-ring-of-shielding|Ring of Shielding.]]  The ring requires attunement.



==== 5. Slave Pens ====
//This long room is partitioned into three areas, with iron bars walling off the north and south.  Filthy straw lines the floors of those cells, the hinged doors of which are secured by chains and padlocks.  A pair of disheveled human women are held in the cell to the south, while a human boy is confined to the north.  All are dressed in plain grey tunics and have iron collars fitted around their necks.  A heap of discarded clothing is piled carelessly against the far wall.//

2 [[Redbrands]] guard this room.  If the party fights the skeletons in the 4.Tresendar Crypts, they hide behind the door and try to ambush the party.

The heap of clothing contains at least a dozen sets of clothing.

The cell doors require a DC 10 lockpicking check, DC 22 strength check, or key from [[Iarno Albrek aka Glasstaff]] or [[Mosk]] to open.

The 3 humans are [[:Mirna Dendrar|Mirna Dendrar]], her 22 year old daughter [[:Nisa Dendrar|Nisa Dendrar]], and 10 year old son [[:Nars Dendrar|Nars Dendrar]].  They were abducted after the [[Redbrands]] killed her husband [[Thel Dendrar]], and are being prepared for sale into slavery.
  The Dendrars know that the [[Redbrands]] boss is a human wizard, and they have "tall, furry monsters with big ears working for them" (bugbears).
  Mirna has nothing to offer as reward, but she tells the adventerurs where her family's heirloom, and emerald necklace is hidden in the [[Ruins of Thundertree]].
  When she was a young girl, her family had to flee Thundertree after undead overran the place.  They used to run an herb and alchemy shop and they left all their belongings there.

**Developments**
If the players save the Dendrars, they flee back to town and promise to help the adventerurs in any way they can.


==== 6. Armory ====
//Racks of weapons line the walls of this chamber, including spears, short swords, long swords, light crossbows, and bolts.  A dozen dirty red cloaks hang from hooks by the door.//

The door to the armory is locked.


==== 7. Storeroom and Workshop ====
//This area is the north end of a large natural cavern, but it has been finished with dressed stone block walls and a flagstone floor.  Several barrels are stored against the walls here, along with a number of empty crates, straw for packing, hammers, pry bars, and nails.  The cavern continues for some distance to the south.  You can make out several passages that open up off the larger cavern, and what looks like a deep pit or crevasse in the floor.//

This room contains secret doors to the 6.Armory and 12.Glasstaff's Quarters.

**Loot**
30 beaver pelts.


==== 8. Crevasse ====
//A cold breeze fills this large natural cavern, carrying with it the faint scent of decaying flesh.  A crevasse divides the cavern and is flanked by two rough stone columns that support the twenty-foot-high ceiling.  Two arched wooden bridges span the chasm.//

A crazy, chaotic evil nothic named [[Grendel]] who would rather deal than fight lurks on the west end of the cavern.  
  The nothic was here before the redbrands, and made a deal with [[Iarno Albrek aka Glasstaff]] .  
  He guards this passage in exchange for treasure and food.  [[Grendel]] will betray Iarno for treasure or food.
  He speaks telepathicly and knows common.
  He offers a deal to non-good players.
	[[Jober]]: Kill [[Gundren Rockseeker]], get the location of [[Wave echo cave]].
	[[Othard]]:  Ruin [[Linene Greywind]], get the location of [[Wave echo cave]] . 

The bridges are simple wooden planks with supporting beams.  DC 10 strength check to dislodge a support and crash the bridge. 
The south bridge is trapped to collapse in the center.  DC 15 investigation to discover trap.

**Developments**
If the players deal with the nothic, he threatens them for more treasure and/or food when they leave the complex.

**Loot**
The nothic's treasure hoarde is under the northern bridge. It contains 200 gp, a [[https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Augury#content|Scroll of Augury]], and a magical sword in a silver chased scabbard, [[Talon]] .



==== 9. Guard Barracks ====
//This barracks contains four roughly built wooden bunks, with heaped-up blankets and dirty dishes scattered about.  A strong smell of unwashed bodies and rotten meat fills the air.  Three tall, furry bugbears are lounging among the mess, barking orders at a sad little goblin that demeans itself for their amusement.  Your sudden appearance causes the goblin to faint.//

3 bugbears, one of which is [[Mosk]] and a goblin named [[Droop]] are here.
  [[Mosk]] wears a gemstone inlaid eyepatch even tho he has both eyes.
  If the party are wearing scarlett cloaks, the bugbears assume they are part of the [[Redbrands]]

**Developments**
If they players defeat the bugbears, [[Droop]] pleads with the party to let him live and escape, he'll do anything.

**What Droop knows**
Droop only knows the general location of [[Cragmaw Castle]]
Droop knows the bugbears and goblins patrolling the area would know where [[Cragmaw Castle]] is.

**What the bugbears know**
[[Mosk]] knows the location of [[Wave Echo Cave]].
All the bugbears know the location of [[Cragmaw Castle]]
DC15 intimidation to get the info

**Loot**

==== 10. Common Room ====
**If the party listens at the door, they hear 4 separate voices.  It sounds like they're playing a game of knucklebones**
//Several worn tables and chairs are scattered around this large room.  Wooden benches are drawn up against walls decorated with draperies of brown and red, and several ale kegs are propped up and tapped.//
//Four tough-looking human warriors wearing scarlet cloaks are gathered around one of the tables.  A stack of coins and trinkets is heaped upon the tabletop between them.//

They players get surprise if they burst into the room.
All four [[Redbrands]] are poisoned.
If the players are wearing red cloaks, they are immediately recognized as imposters.
  "Wait a minute, I aint never seen you before..." **take a pause after this, give them a chance to be witty**

**Loot**
30 gp and a pair of gold earrings with ruby tear drops are on the table (50gp).
There is ale in the kegs.
Any player who drinks a glass recovers 1d4 HP, multiple drinks require a DC5 con save.  The DC increases by 5 per drink. 


==== 11. Wizard's Workshop ====
//This room appears to be a wizard's workshop.  A rat scurries across the floor and takes refuge under a large worktable set up with alembics, retorts, distillation coils, and other alchemical devices, all of it stewing and bubbling away.  Bookshelves are crowded with sheaves of parchment and strange-looking tomes.//

The rat is [[Iarno Albrek aka Glasstaff]] 's familiar
It sends a telepathic message to Iarno as soon as it sees the party.
It has AC10 and 1HP

Any character proficient in arcana can tell the lab is set up to brew Potions of Invisibilty.
  You see an empty phial at the end of the apparatus.
  There is a dripping sound coming from the phial 
  The phial contains a Potion of Invisibility.

Most of the books are related to alchemy.
However, there is a Dwarvish tome, the journal of an adventurer named [[Urmon]]
  It describes the history of the [[Lost Mine of Phandelver]] and the [[Forge of Spells]]
	Reread the first 2 paragraphs of the "Background" in the lmop book if needed.
	In addition, [[Urmon]] records that a magical mace named [[Dawnbringer]] was commissioned by priests of [[Lathander, the God of Dawn]]
	The mace was lost when the orc hordes swept across the land.


==== 12. Iarno's Quarters ====
//The walls of this bedchamber are covered with drapes of scarlet cloth.  The furnishings include a small writing desk with matching chair, a comfortable-looking bed, and a wooden chest at the foot of the bed.//

If [[Iarno Albrek aka Glasstaff]] is surprised add...

//Sitting at the desk is a tall, thin, dark-bearded human male in robes, studying a tome.  He wears a princely mantle of ermine.  A beautiful glass staff leans against his char, within easy reach.//

If his familiar alerts him in area 11, Iarno grabs his Staff of Defense and the scrolls in his bed chest, then flees through the secret door to area 7.  This takes two rounds.

If Iarno is caught unawares, he attempts to bargain with the party, offering a share in the wealth of the [[Lost Mine of Phandelver]] for their loyalty, only resorting to fighting if neccessary.

**Developments**
If caught this is what Iarno knows.
  He reports a drow called [[Nezznar the Black Spider]]
  Nezznar sent him 3 bugbears as extra muscle, one of them, [[Mosk]] , knows the way to [[Wave Echo Cave]]
  [[Nezznar the Black Spider]] is trying to use the [[Forge of Spells]] to craft powerful magical items, which he plans to take back to his people.  
  Nobody in the [[Lord's Alliance]] knows of Iarno's betrayal.

Various correspondances lie on Iarno's desk, most are about alchemical research.
There is one letter that stands out
  //Lord Albrek//
  //My spies in Neverwinter tell me that strangers are due to arrive in Phandalin.  //
  //They could be working for the dwarves.  //
  //Capture them if you can, kill them if you must, but don't allow them to upset our plans.  //
  //See that any dwarven maps in their possession are delivered to me with haste.  //
  //I'm counting on you, Iarno.  Don't disappoint me.//
  (Signed with pictogram of a black spider)

**Loot**
If Iarno is surprised, there are 2 scrolls in the bed-chest: a Scroll of Charm Person and a Scroll of Fireball plus the Staff of Defense carried by Iarno himself.
There is also 350 gp worth of coins and gems
