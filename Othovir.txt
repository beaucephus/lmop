====== Othovir ======
Created Saturday 10 August 2019

Othovir is a gifted harness-maker who doesn't talk about his family or where he came from.
He cares about his business, his clients, and his good name.

Othovir belongs to [[:House Margaster]] though he has cut all ties to his family because they secretly worship the arch-devil [[:Asmodeus]] and Othivir wants nothing to do with them.

**ideal** Find what you do well, and do it to the best of your ability.
**bond** I won't allow my name to be tarnished.
**flaw** I get angry when others pry into my private life.


===== Quest =====
Othovir expresses his gratitude to the party by sharing a secret with them.
He knows the location of a stash of magic items that the Margaster family keeps locked away for emergencies. (Othovir is a Margaster)
The family owns a three-story tower in [[:Silverymoon]] that has a detached carriage house on the property, and it is here that the characters must travel.
Othovir knows:
	The carriage house is a 30-foot square stone building with 2 floors.
	There are guards that stay in the second floor.
	The carriage is on the ground floor.
	The door to the carriage house is protected by a magic spell.
	The items are stored in a secret compartment somewhere inside the carriage. (DC18 investigation to find quickly)
	The carriage has 2 horses harnessed to it at all times, ready to go at a moments notice.
	
Othovir doesn't know:
	The guards are actually **cambions**.
	The spell guarding the door is Arcane Lock.
	There is a silent Alarm spell on the carriage itself.
		The Alarm spell alerts the 2 **cambion** guards and A Margaster **mage** in the tower proper.
