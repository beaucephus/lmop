====== Wave Echo Cave ======
Created Wednesday 16 January 2019
Fifteen miles east of Phandalin, in the deep vales of the [[Sword Mountains]] lies Wave Echo Cave.  The rich mine of the Phandelver's Pact was lost five hundred years ago during orc invasions that devastated this part of the World.

--------------------

==== 1. Cave Entrance ====
//The entrance tunnel leads into a large cavern containing three stalagmites. Int the western part of the cave, are two bedrolls and a heap of ordinary supplies--sacks of flour, bags of salt, casks of salted meat, lanterns, flasks of lamp oil, pickaxes, shovels, and other gear. Amid the supplies, you see the body of a dwarf miner, dead for at least a week.//
//The northeastern section of the cavern has collapsed, forming a deep pit.//

This was the campsite of the Rockseekers
The dead dwarf is the middle brother, Tharden.
DC15 Athletics to climb up or down the pit w/o rope
Tunnels lead to areas 2 and 3.

[[Vyerith]] and some drow elite warriors with 35 HP keep watch in this area. If they players fought the stone defenders, the drow hear them coming.
  Vyerith has a scroll of haste which she uses at the start of battle. (speed doubled, +2 AC, advantage on dex saves, additional attack)
  She uses her slippers of spider climbing to climb to the ceiling, calls for Darkness and uses Blinding arrows from behind stalagtites.
  The warriors use darkness and faerie fire to disrupt the players

// A sturdy hemp rope is tied off around a nearby stalagmite and dangles down the side of the pit,  at the bottom of which is a rough-hewn tunnel heading northwest and east.//

**Loot**
[[Vyerith]] loot and intricate drow scale mail


--------------------

==== 2. Mine Tunnels ====
//This area consists of numerous intersecting passages. The ceilings here are only six fee high, and several of the passages end in partially excavated rock faces.//

--------------------

==== 3. Old Entrance ====
//Many tunnels intersect at this natural, thirty-foot-high cavern. The walls are carved with simple reliefs showing dwarf and gnome miners hard at work. Below them, nearly 30 skeletons in rusted scraps of armor are scattered across the cavern floor. Some are dwarf skeletons, while others are orc remains. 6 large brass lanterns stand in niches or on ledges around the caver, but none are lit.  A single large stalactite hangs near the center of the room.//

The stalactite is a roper.  It attempts to surprise the party.
  If the roper is triggered, the skeletons(18) from areas 4 and 5 come 1 round later.


--------------------

==== 4. Old Guardroom ====
//Splintered stone benches and heaps of rubble from a partially collapsed ceiling fill this room. Amid ruined stone bunks and toppled weapon racks are the bones of several dwarves and orcs.//

If any living creature enters this room, 9 skeletons stir and attack.  Another 9 come from chamber 5.


--------------------

==== 5. Assayers' Office ====
//This chamber was once an office or storeroom of some kind. A large stone counter bisects the room, set with three dusty balance scales made of iron. Cubbyholes carved into the north wall are stuffed with dusty paper scraps. Several long-dead corpses--gnomes and orcs by their look--are sprawled across the floor.//

9 skeletons

**Partially open door, any character that stops to listen hears faint crunching and splintering sounds.**
//Old stone bunks in orderly rows line the walls of this chamber, and a corroded iron brazier full of old coals stands near the middle of the room. The bones of a half dozen dwarves and orcs lie strewn abount, clad in scraps of armor. Several gray, hunched figures squat aomng the remains, pawing at the scraps and gnawing on the bones.//

5 ghouls, and 1 ghast attack immediately.


--------------------

==== 7. Ruined Storeroom ====
//The eastern wall of this chamber has collapsed into a mass of rubble. To the north, a door stands ajar.//

In the door: //The door leads to a good-sized storeroom. Dusty kegs are tucked neatly against the walls, all of them cracked and split open from age.//

The storeroom could serve as a resting place.
No monsters come this way, and the door is in good shape and could easily be barred or blocked from the inside.


--------------------

==== 8. Fungi Cavern ====
//Dense carpets of weird fungi cover large sections of the floor in this cavern. The growth includes puffballs a foot across, weird shelf fungus growing on stalagmites, and large stalks and caps a good five feet tall. Some of the puffballs glow with an eerie green phosphorescence.//

Dim light fills this cavern due to the glowing fungi.

Any attempt to cross the cavern triggers the fungi to release a stinky, colorless poisonous gas.
  Any creature in the chamber must make a DC11 con save or take 3d6 poison dmg and be poisoned for 10 minutes.
  Any creature that ends their turn in the chamber, must repeat the save.
  The gas disperses after 1 minute.


--------------------

==== 9. Great Cavern ====
//Steep escarpments divide this large cavern into three sections--high ledges at either end, and a lower section in the middle. Carved stone stairs climb up to the ledges. Two large tables stand in the middle section, along with a pair of old braziers. A smaller table stands on the eastern ledge. The skeletal remains of dozens of dead warriors--dwarves, gnomes, orcs, and ogres--attest to the fierceness of the fighting that took place here long ago.//

This room is empty of monsters and treasures.  All meaningfull loot was plundered hundreds of years ago.

--------------------

==== 10. Dark Pool ====
//A still pool fills much of this cavern. The water is dark, revelaing little of what might lie within. The shore of the pool consists of a thin layer of broken shells from strange, pale mussels, and a fishy odor hangs in the air. A passage leads south from this area, and a set of steps climbs up to the east. A sluggish stream flows out of the cave to the northeast.//

The pool is 20 feet deep in its center.
The stream is 3 feet deep and the tunnel it creates is 6 feet tall, it permits character movement to area 18.

If coming from the west: //Across the room is another door, this one blocked by a barricade made from the remains of a wooden table.//

//A blast funace and a mechanical bellows powered by a a waterwheel dominate this large chamber.  The furnace is glowing with low heat and heaps of coal are piled nearby, along with carts full of unrefined ore.  The waterwheel sits in a ten-foot-wide channel cut into the floor of the room, but the channel is dry.  Passages exit to the west, south, and east.  The empty channel exits to the north and east.//
//More than a dozen withered corpses are scattered around the room.  These slain dwarves and orcs are still wearing the remnants of their armor.  Floating above them is a skull engulfed in green flame.//

--------------------

==== 13. Starry Cavern ====
//Glittering minerals in the ceiling of this large cavern catch the light and send it back to create the impression of a starry night sky.  Dozens of skeletons--many crushed under fallen debris--are scattered across the floor.//
//The cave is large enough that it contains two freestanding structures.  Each of these stone buildings is proportioned for human use, as opposed to the dwarf-sized doorways and furnishings you've seen elsewhere in the mines.  Both structures have battered and blackened masonry walls, their double doors cracked and scorched.//
//Passages lead out of this area to the north, south, and west.//

See rooms 14 and 15 for the building descriptions.

==== 15. Forge of Spells ====
The doors are cracked, their iron hinges partially melted. DC15 strength to open.
//This large workshop was badly damaged by the ancient spell battle that laid waste to the mine. Worktables taking up two corners of the room are scorched, and the plaster has been burned off the masonry walls. In the middle of the room, a stone pedestal holds a small brazier in which an eerie green flame dances and crackles. The brazier and its pedestal appear to have been untouched by the forces that destroyed this area.//
//Behind the brazier of green flame floats a spherical creature measuring roughly four feet in diameter. Four eyestalks protrude from its central mass, two on each side. In the center of the body is a large eye that stares at you.//
//"Hello," says a thick, burbling voice inside your head.//

Spectator named "Fiver"
  If blinded he planar shifts thinking he can no longer protect the forge.

--------------------

==== 16. Booming Cavern ====
//A narrow ledge overlooks a large cavern that houses a surging, seething body of water that disappears into the darkness of the northeastern portion of the cavern. The rhythmic booming heard throughout the mines is louder here. At regular intervals, a fresh surge of water funnels into this chamber and slams against the wall just below the ledge. The echo suggests that this cave might be one arm of a much larger cavern to the northeast. Lying near the ledge is a broken and battered skiff made from a strange type of wood and rigged with ropes of spider's silk.//

The ledge is 15 feet above the water level. However, when water surges into the cave every 2 minutes it raises the water level by 10 feet, after which the water slowly recedes to its normal level.


--------------------

==== 17. Old Streambed ====
//This passageway is barely four feet high and is obstructed by rounded boulders and pebbles.//

It used to be a stream bed fed by the pool in area 10, but no water flows here now.
This passage was probably used by [[Lythrana Yril'Lysaen]] and her troops to enter the cave.


--------------------

==== 18. Collapsed Cavern ====
//A wide rift fills the eastern half of this cavern. A stream pours out of the west wall, then tumbles down into the rift and flows out again to the north. Several ropes are secured to iron stakes along the western edge of the rift, leading down to the chasm floor.//

The chasm is 30 ft down. DC 17 climbing check to climb the walls in 1 round

--------------------

==== 19. Temple of Dumathoin ====
//Six cracked marble pillars line the walls of this hall, at the north end of which stands a nine-foot-tall statue of a dwarf seated on a throne, a mighty stone warhammer across his lap. Large emeralds gleam in the statue's eyes.//
//The dust and debris covering the floor has been swept to one side, and a campsite of sorts now spreads in front of the statue. Half a dozen bedrolls and packs are neatly arranged around a rough-built fire pit. A wooden table stands on the west side of the room between two pillars.//

If enemies unaware of party: //Two drow stand by the table, one a heavily armored male, and another a female dressed in black leather armor and robes. She stands nearly a foot taller than the male and wider at the shoulders as well. She clutches a black staff with a carved spider at the top and scowls as she sees you enter.//

If enemies are aware: //The unomoving body of a young dwarf sits leaned agains the base of the statue.  You hear a low, pain-filled moan coming from the dwarf.//
