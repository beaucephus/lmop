====== Rassalantar ======
Created Friday 05 July 2019

__A quiet village well known for its soft beds and rich ale.__
__A few walled farms and grazing sheep around the town.__
__A ruined keep hidden among the stand of trees west of the village.__

[[:Waterdeep]] keeps a __large contingent of city guards here__ using a __nearby barracks__ as a headquarters for __patrols up and down__ the [[:Long Road]] to [[:Amphail]] and [[:Waterdeep]]

[[Yondral Horn]] runs the local Inn, The [[:Sleeping Dragon]]
  Yondral is on the [[:Black Network]] 's payroll and has heard of the party.
  He runs the only inn in town and has fine rooms which are expensive (25gp per night per person). They have thin walls and Yondral attempts to spy on the players.
  He might offer the rooms freely if the party agrees to investigate the ruined keep.  __Several villagers have complained about glowing lights and strange noises coming from the ruins.__

Rassalanter's keep has largely been robbed of its stone to build other structures in the village, and its cellars and dungeons are waterlogged.
A hidden chamber in the dungeon holds a permanent teleportation circle inscribed with an intricate and complicated sigil and a large mound of dirt.
	A player could copy the sigil on the circle for later use.

The teleportation circle is used by the Blackstaff (Waterdeep's hightest-ranking wizard) to send messages and aid to Rassalantar

The dirt mound is protected by a Glyph of Warding(Confusion DC20)
The dirt mound hides a __5ft-diameter fine crystal jar with corked lid which contains what appears to be a human fetus floating in a translucent liquid.__  It's Blackstaff's clone.
	The jar is worth 2000gp
