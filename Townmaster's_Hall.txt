====== Townmaster's Hall ======
Created Saturday 12 January 2019

[[Townmaster Harbin Wester]] works and lives here.  He was elected by the town's people to act as the town's only governing official.
He is short squat middle-aged man and is out-of-touch with the recent goings-on in the town including the threat of the [[Redbrands]].
He sees the [[Redbrands]] as nothing more than a band of mercenaries who "will move on in time".  He is wrong.

[[Sildar Hallwinter]] has also set himself up at the Townmaster's Hall.
He corresponds with his contacts in the [[Lord's Alliance]] in [[Neverwinter]].
Unbeknownst to him, most of his communications are being intercepted by [[Cragmaw Goblins]] under orders from [[Nezznar the Black Spider]].
