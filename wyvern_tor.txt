====== Wyvern Tor ======
Created Monday 07 January 2019

Wyvern Tor is a very prominent hill in the foothills between the [[Ruins of Conyberry]] and the [[Sword Mountains]]
It is visible from 20 miles away.
The orc camp can some time to find...Factor this into the party's attempts to find it.

Once they succeed, they follow the smell of smoke to a ravine.
At the bottom of the ravine, there is a cave mouth, outside which sits a single orc keeping watch.
Inside the cave is:
  [[Brughor Axe-Biter]], an orc with 30 HP
  2-6 normal orcs
  1 ogre named Gog.
Gog fights until slain, the orcs flee if Brughor plus half the normal orcs die.

This encounter is potentially super DEADLY!!!
Get the right number of orcs!!!
2 normal orcs = (100*3 + 450) * 2 = 1500
4 normal orcs = (100*5 + 450) * 2 = 1900
6 normal orcs = (100*7 + 450) * 2.5 = 2875


==== Loot ====

a 1d6 greataxes, 2d6 javelins and 1d6 sets of hide armor.
