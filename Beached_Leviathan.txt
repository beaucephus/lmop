**History**
The Beached Leviathan was once the ship Leviathan, owned by a pirate named Harrag,[1] that was pretty infamous around the Sword Coast in the late years of the 15th century DR.[2]

At some point before 1479 DR, the Leviathan ran aground during a storm before the Docks of Neverwinter had been rebuilt,[1] and hopelessly punctured its keel.[7] Unable to use his ship to sail ever again, Harrag refurbished the Leviathan, transforming it into a tavern that soon became popular because of its shape. Harrag was able to open the Beached Leviathan thanks to the patronage of Dagult Neverember, making the tavern a popular spot among his sympathizers
