====== Potion of Flying ======
Created Wednesday 19 June 2019

__This potion's clear liquid floats at the top of its container and has cloudy white impurities drifting in it.__

When you drink this potion, you gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed for 1 hour and can hover. 
If you're in the air when the potion wears off, you fall unless you have some other means of staying aloft.
