====== Beggar's Nest Coven ======
Created Wednesday 17 July 2019

Hag coven in the Beggar's Nest ward of [[:Neverwinter]]

The **annis hag, **[[:Big Agnes]] lives in the [[:Warm Wood]] and has given an **Iron Token** to a local child, Mary Sue.  Mary Sue tries to trick the party to climb the [[:Dungeon:Cloak Tower]] in [[:Quest:Annis's Orphan]]
The **night hag** [[:Black Ethel]] works at the orphanage [[:Little Miracles Orphan Home]] and uses her **Nightmare Haunting** ability on a party member if the annis hag is killed.
The **green hag** [[:Auntie Hilda]]  runs the orphanage.

The **green hag** [[:Auntie Hilda]] runs an orphanage in the Beggar's Nest district of [[:Neverwinter]] called [[:Little Miracles Orphan Home]]
The **Annis hag** [[:Big Agnes]] corrupts the children until they are exiled or run away from their homes.
Then Auntie Hilda takes them into the orphanage.
There the children are prepared by the **night hag **[[:Black Ethel]] to be prepared and eventually consumed by one of the 3 hags.


Regional effects while in [[Begger's Nest]] due to the coven.
	Birds, rodents, snakes, spiders, or toads (or some other creatures appropriate to the hag) are found in great profusion.
	Beasts that have an Intelligence score of 2 or lower are charmed by the hag and directed to be aggressive toward intruders in the area.
	The gravel stones on a safe-looking path, road, or trails occasionally become sharp for 100-foot intervals. Walking on these areas is like walking on caltrops.
	Trees transform into awakened trees and attack when hostile intruders are near.
	Shadows seem abnormally gaunt and sometimes move on their own as though alive.
	Intelligent creatures see hallucinations of dead friends, family members, and even themselves litter- ing the hag's realm. Any attempt to interact with a hallucinatory image causes it to disappear.
	
Specifically the hags have enchanted packs of city dogs who patrol the Beggar's Nest and report going's on to the coven.
