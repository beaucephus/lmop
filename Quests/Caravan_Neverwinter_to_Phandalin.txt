Created Sunday 06 October 2019

There is a general mood of unrest and distrust towards the Lord's Council as of late.

A caravan of wealthy citizens is heading south on the high road, some of the people are heading towards [[:Phandalin]]
The caravaners have pooled their resources and packed hastily. The caravan is protected only by a handful of family stewards and guards.
The caravaners will pool their gold to hire the party for protection.


A raiding party of **frost giants** attacks the caravan as it travels south on the High Road
They attempt to sling giant nets around entire caravan wagons, sling them over their backs, and retreat with the wagons.
They retreat if one giant is slain.

The caravan pools together 50gp to pay the party for protection on their travel to Phandalin
