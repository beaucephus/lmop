====== Lord Ulthein's plea for help ======
Created Sunday 06 October 2019

__For his highness, Hekaton, King of the Giants__

__Neverwinter, a realm of men, and a city most dear to my heart has fallen under the wing of tyranny. The Lord Protector is steering the city towards a path of empire and despotism. I fear he may ruin my fair city in his quest for power. In order to avert that fate, I request your aid in an attempt to overthrow the Tyrant of Neverwinter and his supporters. Our peoples can learn much from each other and better both our kingdoms, but only if the Lord's Alliance is allowed to steer the city to this fate.__

__Humbly,__

__Alabaster Ulthein, Lord of the Alliance__
