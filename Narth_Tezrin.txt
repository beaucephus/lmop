Created Saturday 10 August 2019

Narth is a clerk and co-owner at the [[:Lionshield Coster]] in [[:Triboar]]
He has an adventerous spirit and wants to impress [[:Alaestra Ulgar]] who he has a crush on.

**ideal** The bigger the risk, the greater the reward.
**bond** I adore my colleague Alaestra, and I'd like to do something to impress her.
**flaw** I'll risk life and limb to become a legend.


===== Quest =====
A few month ago, the Lionshield Coster received a payment from one [[:Amrath Mulnobar]] , castellan of [[:Noanar's Hold]] , for 5 horse harnesses made by none other than Triboar's finest harness-maker, [[:Othovir]] .
Othovir recently finished the harnesses and Narth needs to arrange for their delivery.
Since the recent giant attacks, Narth is worried about the safe arrival of the shipment.
Narth has never been to Noanar's Hold, but he knows its a village near the [[:High Forest]] that once attracted wealthy hunters.

Narth offers a cart and horse (Boris) plus 100gp as payment for the delivery.
Run [[:Encounter:Harness Delivery to Noanar's Hold]] when the players arrive.
