====== Moonstone Mask ======
Created Wednesday 26 June 2019

The Moonstone Mask is one of the most renowned festhalls in Neverwinter and across all Faerûn.
The staff was composed only by females wearing glowing, moonstone-trimmed masks (hence the name of the establishment) and sheer black gowns.

The Moonstone Mask was a five-stored building. The first floor was the dining room, lit by a huge heart and by lanterns hanging from the sides of the grand staircase. The next three floors had the particularity of being soundproof, thanks to magic cast during the construction of the inn. Those floors were dedicated to rent their luxurious rooms to travelers and regular patrons. The fifth floor served as the festhall. The roof had a landing platform for winged steeds and flying ships

Ophala had twelve battle horrors at her disposition to protect the Mask. She was also a skilled and powerful wizard.

**history**
Around 1363 DR, Ophala Cheldarstorn built the Mask seeking to run a friendly place she would like to stay in. The Mask became widely popular in the North and around the Sword Coast in the following years.[1]

During the Spellplague of 1385 DR, the land around the inn was affected and became an earthmote. Quick thinking guests secured it with tethers, and dozens of thick ropes as if were an anchored ship. The inn floating in the sky quickly became popular across all Faerûn that same year.[2]

However, when Mount Hotenow erupted in 1451 DR, the ropes holding the earthmote in place were destroyed and the earthmote wandered off aimlessly over the Sea of Swords for months. When the owners were able to alter its course and return it to Neverwinter, the city was devastated and almost deserted. Even after its owners re-opened the Mask and bound it to the harbor of Neverwinter using giant chains, the Mask quickly fell to bankruptcy and eventually was abandoned.[2]

Some time before 1479 DR, Liset Cheldar, a presumed descendant of Ophala, approached Lord Neverember and convinced him to not only allow her to reclaim the Mask, but also to sponsor its reopening. In the years following its reopening, the Mask recovered its status as one of the most popular festhalls across Faerûn
