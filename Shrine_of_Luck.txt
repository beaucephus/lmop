====== Shrine of Luck ======
Created Tuesday 08 January 2019

Shrine to [[Tymora, Goddess of Luck]].

[[Sister Garaele]] lives in a small cottage behind the shrine and offers the party to use a divination spell to learn the location of [[Gundren Rockseeker]] in exchange for retrieving [[Arthindol's Spellbook]] from [[Agatha the Banshee]]

She learns the Discern Location (3e) spell from [[Arthindol's Spellbook]] which she could use to locate Gundren.
