====== Begger's Nest ======
Created Wednesday 17 July 2019

Poort area in the southeast of [[:Neverwinter]]

It's currently inhabited by the [[:Beggar's Nest Coven]]

Potential regional effects due to the coven while in the Beggar's Nest.
	Birds, rodents, snakes, spiders, or toads (or some other creatures appropriate to the hag) are found in great profusion.
	Beasts that have an Intelligence score of 2 or lower are charmed by the hag and directed to be aggressive toward intruders in the area.
	The gravel stones on a safe-looking path, road, or trails occasionally become sharp for 100-foot intervals. Walking on these areas is like walking on caltrops.
	Trees transform into awakened trees and attack when hostile intruders are near.
	Shadows seem abnormally gaunt and sometimes move on their own as though alive.
	Intelligent creatures see hallucinations of dead friends, family members, and even themselves litter- ing the hag's realm. Any attempt to interact with a hallucinatory image causes it to disappear.
	
Specifically the hags have enchanted packs of city dogs who patrol the Beggar's Nest and report going's on to the coven.
