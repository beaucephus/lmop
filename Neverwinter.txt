====== Neverwinter ======
Created Wednesday 12 June 2019

__Once known as "The Jewel of the North", the city of Neverwinter was badly damaged when nearby Mount Hotenow erupted about 30 years ago. Now the "City of Skilled Hands" works furiously to rebuild itself. Neverwinter's reconstruction is far from complete, however. Some of its outer walls still ie in ruins, and several of its neighborhoods remain abandoned. Even so, the damage caused by the great eruption is being undone day-by-day, and that bodes well for Neverwinter's future.__
