====== Ash Zombies ======
Created Sunday 13 January 2019

Ash zombies overran what is now the [[Ruins of Thundertree]] 30 years ago after the eruption of [[Mount Hotenow]]
They linger in the town and are caked in strange magical ash.
They are regular zombies with the following additional trait.

Ash Puff. The first time the zombie takes damage, any living creature within 5 feet must succeed on a DC 10 CON save or be incapacitated for 1 minute.
Think pepper spray!
