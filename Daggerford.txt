====== Daggerford ======
Created Thursday 04 July 2019

__Built on a hillside in the floodplain of the __[[:Delimbiyr River]]__ , the walled town of Daggorford is dominated by a three-story keep__ that belongs to its duchess, [[:Morwen Daggerford]] . __Dozens of farms and a scattering of hamlets are visible in the lands surrounding the town__, all under the protection of the duchess and the [[:Lord's Alliance]] .

Unknown to Daggerford's citizens, a **succubus** named [[Pencheska]] has usurped Morwen's identity and now governs in her stead.
The succubus has imprisoned the real duchess in [[:Cromm's Hold]] , a keep on the the edge of the [[:Lizard Marsh]] .
Pencheska is using her position to infiltrate the Lord's Alliance. She rules daggerford much as Lady Morwen did, sternly but fairly, and does little to arouse suspision.
Pencheska has forged an alliance with the [[:Zhentarim]] leader known as the [[:Snail]]

Run [[:Encounter:Meeting the Snail]] the first time the players visit Daggerford.
