====== Ghelryn Foehammer ======
Created Saturday 10 August 2019

Ghelryn hates giants and orcs almost to the point of madness.
Otherwise he is a good and wise old dwarf blacksmith.

**ideal** It is incumbent upon every dwarf to protect his family and property.
**bond** I love my dear niece [[:Tiffin Foehammer]]
**flaw** I get worked up into a temper-filled fury when it comes to orcs or giants.
