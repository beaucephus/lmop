Group of bandits based in the ruins under [[Tresendar Manor]] in [[Phandalin]].  
They are lead by [[Iarno Albrek aka Glasstaff]] aka Glasstaff.
They are under the orders of [[Nezznar the Black Spider]] to sew chaos and instability in the [[Triboar Trail]] area.

They patrol the streets of [[Phandalin]] and attempt to run off any new comers.

**Encounter: Redbrand Ruffians**
4 redbrands attack the party either leaving a building or on a street out of town.
2 try to distract from the front, 2 try to sneak up from behind
the leader tries to distract them what a "made you look" gag
  if he succeeds, everyone who looks is surprised
if they redbrands win, they take everybody's stuff and tie them up in the dungeon of the [[Redbrand Hideout]]
  Their things are half boxed up in the storeroom area of the hideout

**What the Redbrands Know**
The leader is a human nick-named Glasstaff
[[Nezznar the Black Spider]] hired the [[Redbrands]] to scare off adventurers and intimidate the locals,
  he sent bugbears to help.
The lower part of the [[Redbrand Hideout]] is guarded by a hideous "eye monster" 
There are captives in the holding area of the [[Redbrand Hideout]] "near the old crypts", the crypts are guarded by skeletons.
