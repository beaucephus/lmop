====== Old owl well ======
Created Monday 07 January 2019

[[Hamun Kost]] has set up tent at the Old owl well along with his 12 skeletons.

===== 19/01/10 =====

The party visited Hamun and food poisoned him, infiltrating his tent, but stealing nothing.
They found the old owl well itself to be 200 ft deep with something shiny at the bottom.  It is probably a [[Sling of Critical Accuracy]].
The party left, leaving Hamun and his skeletons to their business.

Hamun and the skeletons continue to search and his skeletons even kill a few young adventurers who try to fight them off.
[[Daren Edermath]] knows the undead are still active near the well.
