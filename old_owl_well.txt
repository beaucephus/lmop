====== Old owl well ======
Created Monday 07 January 2019

[[Hamun Kost]] has set up tent at the Old owl well along with his 12 skeletons.  He is searching for [[Arthindol's Spellbook]] , rumored to be in the position of an old banshee ([[Agatha the Banshee]])

===== 19/01/10 =====

The party visited Hamun and food poisoned him, infiltrating his tent, but stealing nothing.
They found the old owl well itself to be 200 ft deep with something shiny at the bottom.  It is probably a [[Sling of Critical Accuracy]].
The party left, leaving Hamun and his skeletons to their business.

Hamun offered to teach Jober about necromancy in exchange for dealing with the orcs at [[wyvern tor]]

Hamun and the skeletons continue to search and his skeletons even kill a small party of prospectors who try to fight them off.
[[Daren Edermath]] knows the undead are still active near the well.
He is frustrated that they players didn't "at least dispatch the undead", given time they will eventually kill. It is their nature"
He implores them to go back out and deal with the undead.
If the players don't agree, Daren will resolve to set out to dispatch the undead and at least drive off the necromancer.
He is no match for [[Hamun Kost]] , and will be slain and zombified.
