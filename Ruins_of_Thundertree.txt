====== Ruins of Thundertree ======
Created Sunday 13 January 2019
**MAKE SURE THE PART ENTERS FROM THE WEST!!! HAVE A TRAIL LEAD THEM THERE!**
Thundertree used to be a prosperous Lumber and Trapper settlement due to the bountiful supply of timber and animal pelts from the [[Neverwinter Wood]] and [[Neverwinter River]]
However about 30 years ago a clamity struck the village.
[[Mount Hotenow]] to the north erupted and a plague of strange zombies swept over the village, driving out or killing all of its inhabitants.
In the aftermath of the disaster, strange magic has mutated the plant life into new and dangerous forms.
[[Mirna Dendrar]] was a young girl living in Thundertree when the disaster struck.  Her family owned a small herbal and alchemical shop in the village.  They fled leaving most of their belongings behind.


__Gradually, the trail becomes and old, overgrown lane winding between dilapidated buildings choked in vines and brush. Ahead of you, in the middle of the settlement, rises a steep hill, upon which stands a stone tower with a partially collapsed roof and an adjoining cottage. A dirt road hugs the base of the hill and winds its way between old stone houses, many of which are roofless ruins with interiors open to the weather. Other building appear more or less intact.  The whole place is eerily silent. A wooden sign is nailed to a post nearby. It reads:__
__  "DANGER! Plant monsters AND zombies! Turn back now!"__

===== 2. Blighted Cottages =====
__These ruined, side-by-side cottages look as though they might have been the homes of prosperous shopkeepers or well-off farmers in their time.  All that remains are collapsed walls and piles of debris among the shrubs and vines.  Several young trees have grown up in the midst of the ruins.__

===== 5. Blighted Farmhouse =====
__This ruin looks as if it might once have been a farmhouse. It is now half swallowed by a dense thicket, with trees growing up through its ruined foundations. The lane continues south a short distance past the ruin before ending in an overgrown field.__

A door leads into the cottage, and several arrow-slit windows are visible in the tower. You can't help but notice an eerie quiet in the area and a strange, acrid smell in the air.__
__The corpses of two hideous giant spiders are sprawled near the edge of the pathway, apparently dragged there. Their bloated bodies are puckered and blistered, and appear to have been mauled by something big.__

[[:Venomfang]] lives in the tower.
If the players make a lot of noise in the cottage, the dragon automatically knows they're coming.

===== 10. Town Square =====
__On the east side of town, the lane opens up to form a small square. Several ruined buildings surround the south side of the square, but a larger, intact structure to the north looks like a barracks. One lane leads southeast, another heads southwest around the hill in the middle of the town, and a third way meanders north. In the middle of the square, leaning to one side ever so slightly, is a weathered wooden statue of a warrior cluthing a spear and shield.__

DC15 History check to recognize the statue of an old hero of [[:Neverwinter]] named [[:Palien]]

**Loot**
DC10 survival check to harvest 1 pinch of [[Ash Zombie Dust]] from each zombie.

===== 12. Weaver's Cottage =====
__Heaps of wreckage litter the interior of this ruin. In one corner stands a broken loom. A large humanoid figure crouches over the loom, its green skin pocked and its belly horrendously bloated. Cuts and sores all over its body leak yellow-brown fluid onto the rotted wood floor beneath which sizzles and burns. It turns with a sickening gurgle that seems to originate from its gut as you enter.__

**venom troll** but acid damage

===== 13. Dragon Cultists =====
__This small farmhouse appears to be just another empty home at first glance. However, all the doors are shut and windows shuttered.__

A group calling themselves __The Claw of the Dragon__ reside in this building
