====== Ruins of Thundertree ======
Created Sunday 13 January 2019
**MAKE SURE THE PART ENTERS FROM THE WEST!!! HAVE A TRAIL LEAD THEM THERE!**
Thundertree used to be a prosperous Lumber and Trapper settlement due to the bountiful supply of timber and animal pelts from the [[Neverwinter Wood]] and [[Neverwinter River]]
However about 30 years ago a clamity struck the village.
[[Mount Hotenow]] to the north erupted and a plague of strange zombies swept over the village, driving out or killing all of its inhabitants.
In the aftermath of the disaster, strange magic has mutated the plant life into new and dangerous forms.
[[Mirna Dendrar]] was a young girl living in Thundertree when the disaster struck.  Her family owned a small herbal and alchemical shop in the village.  They fled leaving most of their belongings behind.


//Gradually, the trail becomes and old, overgrown lane winding between dilapidated buildings choked in vines and brush.//
//Ahead of you, in the middle of the settlement, rises a steep hill, upon which stands a stone tower with a partially collapsed roof and an adjoining cottage.//
//A dirt road hugs the base of the hill and winds its way between old stone houses, many of which are roofless ruins with interiors open to the weather.//
//Other building appear more or less intact.  The whole place is eerily silent.//
//A wooden sign is nailed to a post nearby. It reads://
//  "DANGER! Plant monsters AND zombies! Turn back now!"//

1. ==== Westernmost Cottage ====

//Cowering in the shadow of an old tree is a crumbled stone cottage with no roof.  Weeds are rampant here.//

2 Twig Blights are inside trying to hide.
They don't attack, but will come aid the Blights in area 2.


2. ==== Blighted Cottages ====

//These ruined, side-by-side cottages look as though they might have been the homes of prosperous shopkeepers or well-off farmers in their time.  All that remains are collapsed walls and piles of debris.  Several young trees have grown up in the midst of the ruins.//

6 hungy Twig Blights are in this area.  They close in on the players if the players enter either building
One round after fighting erupts, the Twig Blights in area 1 show up.

**Loot**
A chest containing 120 gp lies under the broken flagstone floor, DC10 to find.


3. ==== The Brown Horse ====

//A weathered signboard by the door of this large building shows the faded image of a workhorse holding a flagon of ale.  The building is sagging and dilapidated, but it is more intact than the ruins across the road (area 2).//

There are 4 [[Ash Zombies]] in this building. They are all lying down on the floor or leaning against walls (counts as prone).  They attack when a character enters.


4. ==== Druid's Watch ====

//This small house appears to be in better condition than the ruined and dilapidated structures nearby.//
//The doors are reinforced with heavy iron bands, and thick shutters protect the windows.//

[[Reidoth the Druid]] is in this building
Reidoth is a gaunt, white-haired old human man who doesn't use 2 words when 1 will do.
He brews psychadelic tea, same rules as alcohol.

Reidoth warns the party and suggests that they leave Thundertree before they get themselves killed.
He knows that plant monsters, zombies, and enormous spiders all infest the ruins.
Even worse, just recently a green dragon flew into the tower and is occupying it.
  Since the dragon came, some more shady folk have appeared
	"folk in black masks and cloaks"

Reidoth knows the location of [[Cragmaw Castle]]
He also knows the location of [[Wave Echo Cave]]
  He offers to guide them there if the party is able to chase off the dragon ([[Venomfang]])


5. ==== Blighted Farmhouse ====
