**Leaf's Children's Souvenirs**

	Also, about the souveniers from last session

	most of the children in the orphanage asked for typical things, toys, armor, animals

	Items that are easily procurable witha  few gold pieces.

	However, 1 child had a request that stood out.

	It was a 8ish year old human girl with bronze-tan skin and black hair.  She asked for a meal, a dish Leaf has never heard of.  She said her mom used to make that dish all the time when she was alive.  The little girl doesn't remember where she lived with her mom, only that it was cold and dry. The ground was always a mixture of sand and snow.
