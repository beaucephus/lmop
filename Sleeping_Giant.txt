====== Sleeping Giant ======
Created Sunday 13 January 2019

//The Sleeping Giant is a ramshackle taproom at the east end of town.  //
//Four human men linger on the covered porch, perched on empty ale barrels or leaning against the wall.  //
//They all wear grimy scarlet cloaks, their sullen stares fixed on you as you approach.//
//One of the thugs spits on the ground and slurs,  //

//"Y'all must be the new folk I heard so much about.  We was gonna stalk you out and take each of you alone, but I suppose if you all wanna die together, we can do that too."//
//"Only warning, drop yer stuff where you stand and get outta our town."//

The [[Redbrands]] attempt to surround the party and then grab one of them, hopefully combat ensues.
If the redbrands begin to lose, they run inside.  3 more Redbands await inside and they attemp to ambush the party.
The barmaid is a surly Dwarven woman named Grista, she hides behind the bar.
If they begin to lose in the bar, they run out the back door and towards the secret entrance to the [[Redbrand Hideout]] under [[Tresendar Manor]]

**Developments**
If the players capture a redbrand thug, [[Harbin Wester]] refuses to lock them in the [[Townmaster's Hall]] jail. He is afraid of the [[Redbrands]]
Most of the townspeople are grateful, and might semi-jokingly point them toward [[Tresendar Manor]] to "finish them off"
