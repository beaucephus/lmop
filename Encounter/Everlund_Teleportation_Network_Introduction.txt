====== Everlund Teleportation Network Introduction ======
Created Tuesday 12 November 2019

[[:Dral Thelev]] uncorks a flask of elven wine that he claims is [[:Silverymoon]] 's finest, and pours its contents into small wooden cups - one per character.

Characters who take even the smallest sip are teleported to a parlor in the heart of [[:Moongleam Tower]] , the [[:Harpers]] stronghold in [[:Everlund]]

Once in the tower, a wizard named [[:Krowen Valharrow]] greets the party warmly and grants them access to a Harper secret network of teleportation circles until __the Harpers decide otherwise.__
[[:Inner Circles]]

After showing them the circles, Krowen thanks the party for helping Darathra and offers them a small wooden coffer. 
The coffer contains 6 separate compartments, each of which houses a spell scroll.
