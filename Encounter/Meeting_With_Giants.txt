Created Wednesday 11 September 2019

[[:Lord Ulthein]] of [[:Neverwinter]] and an envoy of storm giants from [[:Maelstrom]] including [[:Queen Neri]] plan to meet on a small island off the sword coast.

They plan to discuss tactics and roles in the [[:Coup of Neverwinter]]

At some point an army of sahuagin attack the meeting.

Then [[:Slarkrethel]] shows up to dispose of the giants with his tentacle slams. The giant envoys push Queen Neri out of the way, and die.

Neri becomes injured and tries to escape, Slarkrethel leaves.

[[:Iymrith]] the ancient blue dragon will chase the Queen down and slay her.

Mirran and Nym will say that the small folk of the [[:Lord's Alliance]] did the deed.
