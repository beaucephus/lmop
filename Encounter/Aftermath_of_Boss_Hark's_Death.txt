====== Aftermath of Boss Hark's Death ======
Created Sunday 07 July 2019

Aftermath of fight in Boss Hark's cave.
Don't forget to describe the __half-eaten human corpse, cubby to the west and the portcullis to the north.__
The cubby is covered by a boulder (13 STR to move) leads to area 8 and is only sized for a tiny creature.  Small creatures can squeeze through

[[:Morak Ur'gray]] is in the portculis.
  
Snigbat, an ambitious female goblin is going to attempt to treat with the players.
She offers to sell the other villagers to the party if they agree to kill the __"blob monster" in the Eastern Cave with the big ground spike.__

If the players don't agree to the terms
	She warns that the bat swarms will kill the weakest of the villagers if they try to flee the cavern without the goblin's help.
	Only the goblins know the secret (They have incenced torches __(smells like rotting onion)__ that pacifies the bats. They burn them as they enter.
	Morak vouches to the truth of her claim.
	
If the players kill and loot Snigbat, they notice a pungent scent __(smells like rotting onion)__ coming from a pack slung around her. It contains 5 incenced torches.
