====== Triboar Quest ======
Created Sunday 02 June 2019

[[:Morak Ur'gray]] makes arrangements to deliver news of the giants' attack on [[:Nightstone]] to [[:Waterdeep]] 
He then reminisces on the death of his friend who died in the Dripping Caves, Darthag Ulgar.  He explains that Darthag owned and ran a franchise of the [[:Lionshield Coster]] in town. 
He asks the party if they will deliver Darthag Ulgar's remains and belongings to his next-of-kin, his ex-wife, [[:Alaestra Ulgar]] , in [[:Triboar]]
	Morak offers no reward, but might suggest that Alaestra might reward them.

Darthag owned a cart and several horses which Morak argues would help the players on the [[:Long Road]] to Triboar.
