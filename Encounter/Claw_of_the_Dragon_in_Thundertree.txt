Created Wednesday 19 June 2019

3 **cultists**
1 **mage (Favric)**

The [[:Hand of the Dragon]] is a cult that reveres and seeks to forge alliances with the powerful dragons of the multiverse.
To that end they are seeking to broker an alliance with the young green dragon [[:Venomfang]] in the [[:Ruins of Thundertree]]
The cultists wear __black cloaks cut to resemble dragon wings and black leather masks with stylized dragon horns__.
The leader is a NE human man named [[:Favric]]

Favric is not interested in fighting and prefers to be left alone.
If the players act amicably to the cultists
  Favric explains that they have come to treat with the dragon in an attempt to __"persuade it to leave its current lair and rule over our lair"__  ( in [[:Neverwinter Wood]] )
  Favric suggests an alliance. __If we can convince the dragon that you are part of the Hand as well, we would stand a better chance of convincing it to join us far from here.__
  Favric, of course, plans to betray them and offer them as sacrifices as soon as they meet the dragon.

**Loot**
35gp accross all the cultists
Favric has a [[:Potion of Flying]] in a stopped vial around his neck
In the main room, Favric has a small coffer containing 3 diamonds (100gp each)
