====== Xantharl's Keep ======
Created Sunday 01 September 2019

**History**
Xantharl was a ranger and explorer of the north that helped to found the fortress-city [[:Mirabar]]

The fortified village that bears Xantharl's name stands in the middle of nowhere, on the west side of a notoriously dangerous and rugged stretch of the [[:Long Road]] .
__An outer wall with heavy crossbows mounted to its battlements encloses a keep sheltered by a steep roof.__ (To shed snow)
__Surrounding the keep are dozens of narrow stone houses with heavy shutters and steep roofs of their own.__

The Falling Orc inn and tavern stands near the main gates next to a stables. It is run by a hulking yet friendly femal half-ogre, Arzastra.

The Lord of Xantharl's Keep is Narbeck Horn.
He is a male shield dwarf **knight** and reports directly to the marchion of [[:Mirabar]] .
He carries a sending stone which he can use to warn the marchion of any impending threat from the south.

The keep itself houses 150 shield dwarf **veterans**
