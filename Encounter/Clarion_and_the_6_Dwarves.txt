====== Clarion and the 6 Dwarves ======
Created Sunday 02 June 2019

Party encounters [[:Clarion]] , an **adult silver dragon**, who swoops down out of the sky and releases 6 heavily armored dwarves (**veterans**) from her front claws.
The dwarves immediately hail the players and lightly interrogate them about [[Encounter:Giants on the Road to Triboar]]
The dwarves are looking for a particular magic item that was being carried in the caravan.
  Remember the [[:Item:Sanctified Bones]] !!!

If the dwarves see [[:Item:Shalamayne]] they demand it returned.
[[:Tiffin Foehammer]] argues that her father wielded it and she decided it goes with the party. She damns the dwarves for "letting her parents die".
After Tiffin's outburst, Clarion will try to convince the other dwarves to leave.
