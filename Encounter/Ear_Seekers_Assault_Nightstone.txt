====== Ear Seekers Assault Nightstone ======
Created Friday 31 May 2019

A horde of [[:Ear Seeker Orcs]] almost 2 dozen strong emerge from the [[:Ardeep Forest]]
__They seem to be hagard and look desperate.__
Upon noticing the obviously fortified village, they change course and head for the west gate.

20 **orcs**
1 **orc Eye of Gruumsh** named [[:Norgra One-Eye]]
1 **orc war chief** named [[:Gurrash]]

They try to fight their way into the city.
If they can't get in, eventually they figure out they can get in through the southern bridge.

If the Seven Snakes are still alive, they dont risk their lives, but they do assist in the defense.
If the guards are still alive, they fire arrows from the high perch on the roof of the keep.
If the characters get into trouble, a group of wood elves emerge from the [[:Ardeep Forest]] , routing the orcs.
  They are lead by a daring wood elf ( [[:Rond Arrowhome]] ) who shouts "You're welcome" with an almost snarling gring as they leave.
