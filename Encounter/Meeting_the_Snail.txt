====== Meeting the Snail ======
Created Thursday 04 July 2019

If the party visits [[:Daggerford]] , the [[:Snail]] who has heard of them brokers a meeting.

In exchange for signing a written agreement stating that they won't interfere in the [[:Black Network]] 's operation in [[:Daggerford]] or accept any quests or special commissions from the Duchess ( [[:Morwen Daggerford]] )
The Snail offers the party
 * Free room and board at the [[:River Shining Tavern and Inn]] , paid for by the [[:Zhentarim]]
 * One riding horse or pony for each party member, with stable fees in [[:Daggerford]] paid for by the [[:Zhentarim]]
 * Ownership of a fortified tower in "fair condition" that overlooks the [[:Delimbiyr River]] west of [[:Orlbar]] (recently abandoned by the Zhents after a **stone giant** attack)

If the Snail can't get the entire party to agree, he ends the meeting politely.

Regardless, he puts a tail on the party.

If the party checks out the tower, run [[:Encounter:Stone Giants at Orlbar Tower]]
