====== Introductions at Misty Magic Cleaners ======
Created Tuesday 06 August 2019

Takes place the first time players enter [[:Misty Magic Cleaners]]

This run-down shop is half-destroyed from the volcanic eruption almost 3 decades ago.

A customer approaches Othard and begins speaking to him like a long-lost friend (This is theive's cant.)

If Othard wants dirt on [[:Lord Ulthein]] the customer communicates to him that the Lord is fairly clean except for a gambling problem.
He can be found most nights at the [[:Beached Leviathan]] casino and tavern, gambling his father's fortunes away.

More information can be given, like guard rotation times for his house, guard bribing, even keys, but those will cost $$$.
