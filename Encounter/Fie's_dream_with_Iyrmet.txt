====== Fie's dream with Iyrmet ======
Created Wednesday 19 June 2019

[[:Fie]] has a dream while unconscious and meets [[:Iyrmet]] , an **astral dragon** who is Fie's patron and the owner of the [[:Cube of Secrets]]

__Standing on the surface of an ocean. The sky above is a featureless black void but the placid-smooth surface of the water below reflects the twinkling of a seemingly endless number of stars.__
__You notice the reflection of a familiar object in the water, the cube.__

Once Fie reaches for the object...

__Your fingers close around where the object should be, but nothing is there.  Instead your hand begins to glow brightly like a glaring white beacon illuminating the darkness around you.__

Let some time pass

__A shadow begins to grow in the water, at first small, but getting larger, larger until its beyond gargantuan.__
__White-furred ears pierce the surface first, but create no wake.  A gigantic draconic head also covered in white fur follows directly underneath you, lifting you out of the water, and you find yourself standing on the snout of an enourmous white-furred dragon. You see its long, thin body rolling in the water for thousands of feet almost as if it would never end. The dragon's 10 eyes open in rows, each glowing a different color. 5 glow with dull colors, black, blue, green, white, and red. 5 glow with a lustrous sheen, copper, bronze, brass, silver, and gold. You hear in your head a booming, deep, slow voice that speaks a language you don't know, nevertheless you understand the words' meaning.__

In secret chat, tell Fie:
__"Consume the flesh of its heart, so that you may become closer to me..."__

Fie awakens to the death screeches of [[:Venomfang]]
