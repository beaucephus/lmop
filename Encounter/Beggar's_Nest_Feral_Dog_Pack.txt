====== Beggar's Nest Feral Dog Pack ======
Created Tuesday 06 August 2019

A pack of 30 street dogs ( **wolves** with 1 HP ) attacks the party in plain sight in the [[:Beggar's Nest]]

The dog's behavior seems abnormally aggresive and is the result of the regional effects of the [[:Beggar's Nest Coven]]

The dogs are seen playing with a group of children in the play-yard of an orphanage.
Once the dogs see the party, they go rabid and attack.

**Developments**
Potentially could lead to an interation between the players and the Hags running the orphanage.
