====== Attack on Triboar ======
Created Wednesday 07 August 2019

[[:Okssort]] and [[Ildmane]] , a pair of mated **fire giants** loyal to [[:Duke Zalto]] , have used a [[:Item:Rod of the Vonindod]] to locate the [[:Vonindod]] fragment burried underneath [[:Triboar]]

''Around noon, the town is shaken from its peacefulness by the screams of women and children, followed by a man yelling, "Giants! Run!" Perplexed residents and shopkeepers emerge from their domiciles in time to see a large rock fall from the sky and crash onto an old cart, splintering the cart and killing the carter. As a cloud of dust erupts from the wreckage, a second rock hits the ground, tumbles through a fence, and slams against the wall of a building, startling a pair of mules tethered to a post nearby. All around you, people begin to shriek and scatter.''

Okssort and Ildmane hurl boulers at the town from range while 5 **orogs**, 6 **orcs** riding **axebeaks**, and 12 **magmins** (split into 2 gangs of 6) assault the town and clear a path from the northeast to the campgrounds.

==== Wave 2 ====
