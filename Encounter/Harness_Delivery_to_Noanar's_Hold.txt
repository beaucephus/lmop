====== Harness Delivery to Noanar's Hold ======
Created Sunday 01 September 2019

This encounter takes place in [[:Noanar's Hold]]

===== In the hold =====
The "hold" at Noanar's hold is nestled among old pine trees on a hilltop overlooking the sleepy village.
It sports 3 turrets, 1 of which has completely collapsed and gapes openly to the sky.
All the windows are bricked up, and the doors are either bricked up, or barred from the inside. (DC27 athletics to break open a barred door)


Its current occupant, [[:Amrath Mulnobar]] is an old half-dwarven servant of the huntlords.
He doesn't open the door unless the characters are delivering saddles.
Amrath allows the characters to place the saddles in the entrance foyer and quickly ushers them to leave.

The hunt lords lurk in a dusty ground-floor banquet hall, slumped in chairs around a cobweb-draped dining table.
They spend their days reminiscing about the "good old times" and attack any creature other than Amrath that disturbs them.
Behind their chairs are piles of horse bones that can be summoned into **warhorse skeletons**

**Loot**
A locked treasure chest at the back of the banquet hall contains what wealth the hunt lords have amassed. (DC20 thieves tools, DC30 strenght)
  600gp in coinage in a strangely beige colored leather sack.
  A smaller sack of similar make contains 6 blue sapphires (50gp each)
  [[:Item:Talon]]
  [[:Item:Alabaster Figurine of Find Familiar (Hunting Dog)]]
  [[:Item:Deadeye]]


Run [[:Encounter:Neverwinter Brothers Inheritance]] if the party doesn't explore the hold and/or encounter the wights.
