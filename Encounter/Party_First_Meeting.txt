You received a letter from your friend, Morak Ur'gray bidding you to come visit him in Nightstone.  
He tells you he has a goblin problem and the local lord is a member of the court at Waterdeep and is paying a bounty for every goblin ear.

You join the company of several other travelers on the same road, and even a small horse-drawn wagon carting supplies bound for Nightstone.
As you near the trail to Nightstone, the wagon rolls over a well-concealed stone in the road.
The axle makes a nasty crunching sound and the wagon slows to a halt.

You look up to see 2 crude arrows dug into the driver's chest.
One of the travelers on foot shouts "Goblins, from the woods!!!", before being hit himself.
You turn towards the woods just in time to ready yourself as a horde of goblins, yipping, and yelping, screeching in joyous glee at the smell of fresh-spilled blood, come barelling out of the woods towards you!

Farther down the road You spot a wooden signpost next to a crossroads where the High Road meets with other winding trails.
Nailed to the post are three arrow-shaped signs. The two marked "Waterdeep" and "Daggerford" point towards opposite ends of the High Road.
The third, marked "Nightstone," beckons you to follow the trail leading north-east.
