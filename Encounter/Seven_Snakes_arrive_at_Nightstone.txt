====== Seven Snakes arrive at Nightstone ======
Created Friday 31 May 2019

The "Seven Snakes" Seven [[:Zhentarim]] mercenaries arrive at the village on horseback.
Led by [[:Xolkin Alassandar]] (LE male half-elf **bandit captain)**
6 others are common **bandits**

If the drawbridge is lowered, they ride into the square and call out for __"Kella"__ [[:Kella Darkhope]]
If the drawbridge is raised, they __shout from the road for someone to lower the bridge__.
If Kella is still alive, she tries to let them in.

The Seven Snakes are on a mission with Kella to convert [[Nightstone]] into a zent base of operations on the [[:Black Network]]

If Kella is a prisoner, Xolkin tries to buy her freedom with his coin purse. If that fails, he attempts to liberate her by force.
If Kella is in the parties good graces, she reveals her allegiance to the [[:Zhentarim]] as soon as the Seven Snakes are close enough to protect her.
Regardless, Kella attempts to convince any neutral or evil PCs to join her and the Zhentarim and help her secure [[Nightstone]] as a [[:Black Network]] base.
  If the party agrees she asks them to prove their conviction by murdering the remaining guards in the keep. (She has caught glimpses of guards still alive in the keep)

If the characters do nothing to oppose the Seven Snakes, Xolkin orders his men to raise the drawbridge and sends a message to the [[:Snail]] either by flying snake or two of his men.
The Seven Snakes are not openly hostile to the players unless they've killed Kella or try to oppose Xolkin

If the players are with the guards, then the guards plead with the characters to rid Nightstone of the bandit occupation.

**Loot**
Xolkin wears studded leather armor and carries a scimitar and several daggers. 
He also wears an obsidian ring emblazoned with the symbol of a black winged serpent (25gp) DC10 history to recognize the symbol of the Zhentarim
He has a coin purse containing 53gp of coins, 2 gemstones (100gp each), and a [[:Item:Potion of Invulnerability]]

The other Seven Snakes members wear leather armor and carry a scimitar and a light crossbow
They carry 2d10gp each
