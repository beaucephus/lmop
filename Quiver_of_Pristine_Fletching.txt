====== Quiver of Pristine Fletching ======
Created Friday 08 February 2019

Well-made quiver with ornate embroidery of jade in the shape of swallow feathers.

Requires attunement
When attuning, set the quiver to arrows or bolts. 
Anything arrow-shaped that is placed in the quiver grows fletchings and a sharp point. It can be used as an arrow or bolt.
Any bolt or arrow placed in the quiver magically improves in quality and becomes a magical +1 arrow or bolt.
