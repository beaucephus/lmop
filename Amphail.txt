====== Amphail ======
Created Friday 05 July 2019

A town north of [[:Waterdeep]] on the [[:Long Road]]
**History.** The town is named after one of Waterdeep's early warlords, who is said to haunt the surrounding hills in spirit form, frightening away monsters.

Horses are trained and bred here, several Waterdhavian noble houses keep estates here.
In the center of the town square stands the Great Shalarn, a black stone statue of a famous war stallion bred in Amphail long ago.
It's covered in grafitti and a few children are playing rider on it.

The local tavern is the Stag-Horned Flagon, run by a gray-haired, middle-aged woman with a wry sense of humor named Arleosa Starhenge.

Amphail is the last town patrolled by Waterdeep's city guard and a small barracks stands here.

Run [[:Encounter:Roaringhorn's Birthday Feast]] the first time the party gets here.
