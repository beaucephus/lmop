====== Townmaster Harbin Wester ======
Created Sunday 13 January 2019

[[Townmaster Harbin Wester]] was elected by the town's people to act as the town's only governing official.
He is short squat middle-aged man and is out-of-touch with the recent goings-on in the town including the threat of the [[Redbrands]].
He sees the [[Redbrands]] as nothing more than a band of mercenaries who "will move on in time".  He is wrong.
