====== Annis's Orphan ======
Created Wednesday 26 June 2019

A young girl dressed in dirty rags stops the party in the street and pleads with them save her brother who went into the cloak tower. [[Dungeon:Cloak Tower]]
  She says __the boys were playing a dare game and the other boys dared him to make it all the way to the top of the tower.__
  The young girl is being corrupted by an Annis Hag whom she refers to as [[:Big Agnes]]
  There is no brother.
  She's gone when the players exit the tower.

If the players find and catch her, they notice a strange iron pendant on her necklace.  Its shaped like a large molar, but made completely of iron.

It was given to her by the **annis hag** [[:Big Agnes]]
