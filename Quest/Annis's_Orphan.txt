====== Annis's Orphan ======
Created Wednesday 26 June 2019

A young girl dressed in dirty rags stops the party in the street and pleads with them save her brother who went into the cloak tower. [[Dungeon:Cloak Tower]]
  She says they were playing a dare game and she dared him to make it all the way to the top of the tower.
  The young girl is being corrupted by an Annis Hag
  There is no brother.
  She's gone when the players exit the tower.

If the players find and catch her, they notice a strange iron pendant in the shape of a serrated tooth.
