====== Phandalin Miner's Exchange ======
Created Sunday 13 January 2019

The Miner's Exchange is a trading post where local miners have their valuable finds weighed, measured, and paid out.

It is a great place for the party to learn about the countryside surrounding [[Phandalin]]

The guildmaster is a young, ambitious, human woman named [[Halia Thornton]]
  Halia tells the players that the redbrands are a problem.
  She knows that they loiter around the [[Sleeping Giant]] taphouse and have a base under the ruins of [[Tresendar Manor]]
  She offers the players 100 gp to eliminate the [[Redbrands]] leader, "Glasstaff" and bring her any correspondance found in his possession
