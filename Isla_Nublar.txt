Isla Nublar is a small island atoll, 5 miles wide and 15 miles long, north-to-south. It is covered in dense forested jungle on the western side and open grassy plains on the eastern side.

It is home to a small colony of grung.
The Grung have a small (<50 members) village on Isla Nublar.
They subsist by enslaving dinosaurs and are at war the ever-encroaching Shuagins of the surrounding sea.
There are no red or yellow (higher castes) grung on the island.
Only green, blue, and purple (lower castes)
They are led by [[:Ja'Hen Zoog Slur'Mog Lurt Rahn]] , the only orange grung.
