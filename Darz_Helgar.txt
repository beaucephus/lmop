Darz works in the main campgrounds in [[:Triboar]]

Darz has a shady past.
He was a member of the [[:Xanathar Thieves' Guild]] in [[:Waterdeep]]
He was caught and imprisoned for 10 years. After his release, he vowed an oath against thievery and moved to Triboar to start a new life.

**Ideal:** You can run from your past, but you can't hide from it.
**Bond** I've made a new life in Triboar. I'm not gonna run away this time.
**Flaw** I have no regrets. I do whatever it takes to survivie.

===== Quest =====
Darz relates to the characters that he was recently visited by an old acqaintance, a merchant from [[:Mirabar]] , with an interesting tale to tell.
The merchant saw a dwarf cleaning stables in [[:Xantharl's Keep]] , a fortified village on the [[:Long Road]] , and later recognized him from a wanted poster he saw while traveling south through [[:Longsaddle]] .
The merchant is sure the dwarf he saw is a wanted brigand known as the Weevil.
According to the poster, he's worth 5000gp if delivered alive to the authorities in Mirabar.
Darz would have gone to collect the bounty in his younger years, but now he's got too much to take care of here in Triboar.

Run [[:Encounter:Attack on Xantharl's Keep]] if the players go after the Weevil.
