====== Forge of Spells ======
Created Sunday 13 January 2019

The Forge of Spells is the magical forge made legendary by tails of the [[Lost Mine of Phandelver]]
It is located in [[Wave Echo Cave]] and is a small stone pedastal holding a brazier of green flame.

Any non-magical weapon or armor bathed in the green flame becomes a +1 weapon or armor for 24 hours.

When properly manned and worked (requires a crew of trained arcanists), it grants various benefits towards the creation of permanently enchanted magic items.
  Magic item crafting requires half the normal time and reagents.
  Magic items crafted using the forge of spells are more powerful than their conventionally made counterparts.
	Magic items with any quantitative effect have numerical bonuses increased by +1, subject to DM discretion.
	  to hit, damage, number of damage dice, spell save DC, AC, etc...
	Magit items witout a quantitative effect have their effect boosted in some way at the DM's discretion
    
Gundren currently oversees operation of the forge with help from [[:Mormesk]] the wraith.
