====== Stone Defenders ======
Created Sunday 14 April 2019

//The lightly wooded area gives way to 20-foot square grotto set in the center of a 40-ft clearing.  On the other side of the grotto, hidden in dense foliage is a huge mound of earth adorned with a 5-foot doorway of worked stone.  A carving of a dwarf is set into either side of the stone doorway.//

If the players inspect the grotto, they find the dead body of a drow fighter in studded leather drown armor.
The dwarfs are Stone Defenders and animate if any creature comes within 5 feet of the doorway.
  They understand Dwarvish, but cannot speak.  They obey commands given in dwarvish.
