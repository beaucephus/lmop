====== Stone Defenders ======
Created Sunday 14 April 2019

//The lightly wooded area gives way to small, shallow grotto set in the center of a clearing.  On the other side of the grotto, hidden in dense foliage are stone steps leading down into a long dug-out.  The area surrounding the dugout and grotto show obvious signs of battle.//

Inside the dug-out: //Adorning the walls on either side of you are life-sized depictions of humans, dwarves, and gnomes working a mine.  An unlit doorway at the far end leads further underground.  A warning is carved into the stone above the doorway.//

The warning says in dwarvish "Danger!  Request safe passage before entering!"
If the players inspect the grotto, they find the dead body of a drow fighter in studded leather drow armor.
The dwarfs are Stone Defenders and animate if any creature comes within 5 feet of the doorway.
  They understand Dwarvish, but cannot speak.  They obey commands given in dwarvish.
