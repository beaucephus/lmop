====== Venomfang ======
Created Wednesday 20 March 2019

Venomfang finds the party and toys with them from the air.
He swoops down and taunts them while breathing poison on them.

If the party is in trouble of TPK, offer an old shack by the road.
The food and water inside is poisoned and the farming family are all dead
They seem to have died from inhaling poison.

**Development**
If any member of the party goes down, 
  the dragon grabs them in its talons and flies off towards [[Ruins of Thundertree]]
If the party finds a way to hide and avoid the dragon breath, 
  it gets bored and flies back towards [[Ruins of Thundertree]]

**ROLL TO RECHARGE AT THE END OF DRAGONS TURN!!!**
