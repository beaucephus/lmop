====== Agatha's Hut ======
Created Monday 07 January 2019

Home of [[Agatha the Banshee]]
It is located just northwest of the [[Ruins of Conyberry]]
An old, unused trail leads northwest out of the ruins, into [[Neverwinter Wood]]

===== 3 Challenges to reach the hut =====

==== First Challenge: Trapped Stirge Cavern ====
Approach a large opening of a cavern 60 ft wide next to road.
Invisible alarm spells are set along the road and cavern opening.
If triggered, a loud bell begins going off and stirges swarm out of the cavern.
1d8 stirges every round as long as the party remains on the road near the cavern opening.
Stirges don't follow past the cavern opening, party just needs to either get off the road or run through.

==== Second Challenge: Pitfall ====
Party hears the moans of an injured animal.  
A large, sprung pitfall trap lies in the road, an owlbear has fallen inside and impaled its rear thigh on a spike.
DC15 animal handling check to calm the owlbear (auto success with food).
The [[Owlbear of Neverwinter Wood]] might show up again if they help it???


==== Third Challenge: Riddle ====
Wall of Force encases the hut.
Ethereal, beautiful visage of [[Agatha the Banshee]] manifests and says,
  "I know why you are here.  You come to the eternal lady of [[Neverwinter Wood]] seeking knowledge and power, but such things must be earned.  First, give me an answer, and then you may find what you seek."
  "Deep as a bowl, round as a cup, Yet all the world's oceans can't fill me up.  What am I?"
	A colander, Sphere of Annihilation, or any container with a hole.  

Once inside, [[Agatha the Banshee]] appears for the party, offers them tea, and offers [[Arthindol's Spellbook]] to them.  
  If they helped the [[Owlbear of Neverwinter Wood]], she offers an enhancement to whoever helped, a feat. 
Agatha hasn't had visitors in a long time.  She savors the company if it is polite and respectful, otherwise she answers the question and hurries them out.
