====== Silverymoon ======
Created Monday 02 September 2019

__The "Gem of the North" is a fitting epithet for Silverymoon: a beautiful, tranquil city where threes and gardens live in harmony with buildings, bridges, and sculptures.__

**History**
Silverymoon is an enlightened place, with a great library, breathtaking temples and shrines, and respected schoools of magic, art, and music.

High Marshal Methrammar Aerasume, the city's lord, resides in a tall, slender palace on the east side of the city.
The city has many magical wards and defenses in addition to its ever watchfull elven guard.

Any member of the [[:Lord's Alliance]] or [[:Harpers]] can easily find a faction house in the city.
