[[:Dungeon:Cloak Tower]]

**History**
The tower took its name from its original owners, the wizard order named the Many-Starred Cloak.[1]

The wizards disappeared alongside their tower during the Spellplague of 1385 DR,[2] when the tower was sent to the Far Realm.[3] When the Cloak Tower returned to Neverwinter, six months later, there was no trace of the wizards, as only their colorful cloaks remained.[2]

Some time after, a group of thieves tried to plunder the tower, but all of them except for one were killed by the cloaks. The Neverwintans avoided the place afterwards.[2]
