====== Unrest at the docks ======
Created Sunday 06 October 2019

The citizens, sailors, and dock workers at the [[:Neverwinter]] docks district are rioting, striking, and picketing.

They are demonstrating because of new edicts issued by the Lord Protector that prohibit what can be traded at the docks.
Shipments of anything that can be used as a weapon and several shipments of raw materials are being seized.
