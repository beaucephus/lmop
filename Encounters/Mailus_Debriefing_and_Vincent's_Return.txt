====== Mailus Debriefing and Vincent's Return ======
Created Tuesday 06 August 2019

Mailus seems stressed. He gets the debriefing from the party.
	He's heard rumors of Lords plotting to overthrow him.
	He wants absolute power and to dissolve the Lord's Council.

Vincent returns and acts as the voice of reason.
	Mailus tasks him with infiltrating the politcal opposition and being a spy for the family.
		Vincent detests the idea.
		Vincent just wants to be a straight-forward merchant.
		__Why do we need all this, can't we just be a family?__
			Mailus responds, __Unfortunately, no. There are more important things than family.__
