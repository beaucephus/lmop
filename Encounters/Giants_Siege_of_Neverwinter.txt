====== Giants Siege of Neverwinter ======
Created Tuesday 15 October 2019

**All perception and investigation checks made at disadvantage due to the smoke, soot, and fire.**

===== On approach at dusk =====
__In the distance, a dim halo of light and a low fog obscures your view of Neverwinter. __

__As you get closer, you begin to make out people, small dots at this distance, moving quicly back and forth along the walls, while larger dots, caravans of horses, carts, and people, all stream out of the south gate and into the surrounding roads and countryside.__
__A round plume of orange light billows up into the sky from somewhere in the center of the city, and a murky, black cloud follows it, high into the night sky.__
__The city of Neverwinter is alight with roaring flame.__

===== The Beggar's Nest =====
__Most of the beggar's nest is a raging inferno. People flee in droves towards the city walls in a panic, holding their cloaks over their mouths and carrying what they can.__

__As you make your way into the city proper moving against the now thinned stream of people running and screaming for their lives and the lives of their loved ones, a 25 foot tall giant clad in full, black plate catches sight of you.__
__She turns towards you and stares with glowing red eyes and hair. She lifts her weapon in your direction, calling out (in giant), and several smaller figures emerge from the nearby rubble and carnage. Half orc, half ogre, Orogs clutching great axes stained red/black with blood and soot stride your way in tight formation. Small, goblin-like, creatures with skin of molten lava bound down off nearby rooftops, leaving searing black marks wherever they step. They already surround you, closing in step by step with the giant behind them.__

1 fire giant
4 orogs
6 magmins
they surround the party. The magmins rush in while the orogs form a perimeter, hurling javelins. The giant hurls flaming chunks of debris.

**Developments**
If the players escape, the giant calls off the orogs, the magmins chase


===== The Three Bridges =====
__Three great bridges span the more than 100 foot wide Neverwinter River as it winds a semicircle around Castle Never. Giant guards stand watch at the __[[:Winged Wyvern Bridge]] and [[Sleeping Dragon Bridge]] .
__The__ [[:Dolphin Bridge]] __is unguarded.__

There are 2-3 hill giants stationed at each guarded bridge.
These typically slow and lumbering giants are on alert and primed for action (DC20 to sneak past)
The hill giants will laugh at what __Tasty things the others gets to eats in the big castle__
__Yeah, we only gets to eats the little ones that tries to cross HA HA__

The dolphin bridge has been mgically trapped by cloud giants.
Several glyphs of warding (DC16 to notice) are set along the bridge. **-5 to passive perception due to the smoke**
Any creature walking across the middle of the bridge triggers all the glyphs which explode in quick succession from the center towards each bank, dealing 5d8 thunder damage (DC16 dex save for half)
Any creature on the bridge when it explodes falls into the river. DC12 athletics to swim straight across, otherwise get swept downstream. (Puts them behind a few rounds in next combat)

This should lead straight into combat once across the bridges.

===== Castle Never Attack =====
__As you approach the castle, you hear sounds of battle from the coutyard out in front of the main entrance__

__Mailus, Alfredo, Vincent, and a handful of city guards stand out in the distant castle courtyard, 200 feet from you.__
__3 giants and 2 smaller white-furred beasts surround them. One particularly tall giant reaches up towards the sky and calls down a lightningbolt which explodes on the guards position, killing the remaining guards.__
What do you do?

Upon approaching the npc
	__The Drapiers and Alfredo stand back to back to back, drenched in sweat and some smattering of blood and soot. Their eyes fall in your direction with looks of surprise and relief as you approach.__

a **storm giant** leading 2 **frost giants** each with a **winter wolf** pet are attacking the castle.

Put the party 200 feet from the giants and npcs
The storm giant orders the **frost giants** to intercept the party (in giant) __while I slay this murderous cur!__
He then focuses all attacks on Mailus. Alfredo attempts to block for Mailus

The frost giants and winter wolves move to intercept anybody they can. The frost giants throw restraining nets around vulnerable enemies and attept to spear them with 30 foot long tree trunks fashioned into great spears (greataxe attack)

While the battle rages, the storm giant goads at Mailus 
__You Lord's Alliance cowards brought this on yourselves.__ 
__You slew our Queen. Queen Neri will be avenged! If war with giant-kind is what you want, then you'll have it!__
__You've allied yourself with that monstrous creature. Slarkrethel will devour you all and turn you into monsters like him!__

**Developments**
The storm giant will flee if the party deals with the other giants or reduces him below 150 HP.
	__You fight valiantly for your leader, small folk. It is a shame you fight for warmongers such as this one.__ (Hops on his flying manta ray and begins to flee flying at 100 feet per round) 
	__I will not give you the pleasure of slaying another member of the royal court this day.__
	__I am Uthor, Imperator of Maelstrom, and I swear, in time, I shall have your treacherous head!!!__
Alfredo is slain depending on how quickly the party forced the storm giant to flee.

===== Vincent confronts Mailus =====
Vincent confronts Mailus about Uthor's goading.
__Did you slay their queen?__
__Who is Slarkrethel?__
__What happened to Lord Ulthein?__

To all questions, Mailus answers with a patronizing __You are still young. You will understand in time.__
Vincent will appeal to Othard
	__Othard, What happened to Lord Ulthein?__

**If none of the players takes the initiative**
Vincent will challenge Mailus to a duel
	Mailus appeals to Alfredo __Apprehend my traitorous progeny.__
		Alfredo stays out of it (if he's not incapacitated or dead) __I will not! The young Lord Drapier has issued a rightful challenge.__
	Mailus appeals to the Party __Slayers of the Spider Queen, apprehend both these traitors and throw them in the castle dungeon.__
		Othard will resist arrest and Alfredo will assist him. They fight to the death for their beliefs.

**If the party sides with Vincent or doesn't intervene**
They duel and Mailus' arm transforms into a tentacle armed with gnarly, serrated hooks
Vincent and Mailus mortally wound each other.
Each appeals to the party for help.

Vincent wants to remove his father from power at w/e cost
	Lord Ulthein was a close mentor and he can never forgive Mailus for ordering his assasination
	Vincent fights to the death for what he believes in.

Mailus wants turn Neverwinter into an empire by force.
	If he fails, he will attempt to escape with a Scroll of Teleport.
