====== Giants Siege of Neverwinter ======
Created Tuesday 15 October 2019

===== On approach at dusk =====
__In the distance, a dim halo of light and a low fog obscures your view of Neverwinter. __

__As you get closer, you begin to make out people, small dots at this distance, moving quicly back and forth along the walls, while larger dots, caravans of horses, carts, and people, all stream out of the south gate and into the surrounding roads and countryside.__
__A round plume of orange light billows up into the sky from somewhere in the center of the city, and a murky, black cloud follows it, high into the night sky.__
__The city of Neverwinter is alight with roaring flame.__

===== The Beggar's Nest =====
__Most of the beggar's nest is a raging inferno. People flee in droves towards the city walls in a panic, holding their cloaks over their mouths and carrying what they can.__

__As you make your way into the city proper moving against the now thinned stream of people running and screaming for their lives and the lives of their loved ones, a 25 foot tall giant clad in full, black plate catches sight of you.__
__She turns towards you and stares with glowing red eyes and hair. She lifts her weapon in your direction, calling out (in giant), and several smaller figures emerge from the nearby rubble and carnage. Half orc, half ogre, Orogs clutching great axes stained red/black with blood and soot stride your way in tight formation. Small, goblin-like, creatures with skin of molten lava bound down off nearby rooftops, leaving searing black marks wherever they step. They already surround you, closing in step by step with the giant behind them.__

1 fire giant
4 orogs
6 magmins
they surround the party. The magmins rush in while the orogs form a perimeter, hurling javelins. The giant hurls flaming chunks of debris.

**Developments**
If the players escape, the giant calls off the orogs, the magmins chase


===== The Three Bridges =====
__Three great bridges span the more than 100 foot wide Neverwinter River as it winds a semicircle around Castle Never. Giant guards stand watch at the __[[:Winged Wyvern Bridge]] and [[Sleeping Dragon Bridge]] .
__The__ [[:Dolphin Bridge]] __is unguarded.__

There are 2-3 hill giants stationed at each guarded bridge.
These typically slow and lumbering giants are on alert and primed for action (DC20 to sneak past)
The hill giants will laugh at what __Tasty things the others gets to eats in the big castle__
__Yeah, we only gets to eats the little ones that tries to cross HA HA__

The dolphin bridge has been mgically trapped by cloud giants.
Several glyphs of warding (DC16 to notice) are set along the bridge.
Any creature walking across the middle of the bridge triggers all the glyphs which explode in quick succession from the center towards each bank, dealing 5d8 thunder damage (DC16 dex save for half)
Any creature on the bridge when it explodes falls into the river. DC12 athletics to swim straight across, otherwise get swept downstream.


===== Castle Never =====
__As you approach the castle, you hear sounds of battle from the coutyard out in front of the main entrance__

__Mailus, Alfredo, and a handful of city guards stand out in the castle courtyard. Drenched in sweat and some smattering of blood and soot, their eyes fall on you with looks of surprise and relief.__
2-3 __ storm giants stand surrounding them. Each winds back for a swing with his 15 foot long great sword.__
__Some of the guards turn to run, some cry out.__
