====== Venomfang's Lair ======
Created Thursday 20 June 2019

__The large green dragon sits in a depression near the center of the room dripping a viscous yellow liquid from the tips of its talons into the open mouth of the not-moving body of Marcus.__

Venomfang has 115 HP

[[:Venomfang]] protects her lair and treasure, but won't risk death for either.
She offers to treat with the party, requesting magic items for her horde in exchange for [[:Fie]] 's life.

If the party offers to trade sufficient magic items
  Venomfang will return [[:Fie]] who will recover after a long rest.
  Venomfang keeps Fie's magic items and relocates her lair as soon as the party leaves.
Else
  Venomfang gives a warning
	__You would forfeit your friend's life over some inconsequential trinkets? Leave, now, or he dies!__

If the players leave
  Venomfang immediately carries off most of her horde to a new lair, leaving Fie behind.

If combat is imminent
  Venomfang bluffs DC15 insight to recognize
	__This one has drank my poison...for hours now...__
	__I am the only one who can restore him.__
	__Slay me and your friend will die with me. *cackles*__



If the players and Venomfang are still at a stand-off
  Venomfang finally offers a truce as __This is going nowhere__
  She offers to release Fie from the poison if the group promises not to slay her and leave.
