====== Kobold Lair ======
Created Friday 08 February 2019
{{.\kobold_lair.png}}

===== Features =====
Medium creatures must crawl in the tunnels and can't turn around.
The tunnels are complete darkness and difficult terrain. (crawling + difficult terrain means 1/3 movement speed)
The rooms are dimly lit by camp fires unless specified otherwise.
Kobolds retreat into deeper rooms or escape tunnels very easily

	Regular light = no problems

	Dim light = disadvantage on perception, but no effect on attack rolls or on combat generally other than perception checks

	Total darkness = can’t see opponent, therefore disadvantage on attack rolls and won’t be able to target opponents with certain spells that require you to see the target.


===== A1: Main Entrance =====
//This tunnel is very narrow and winds several meters into the earth. The tunnel is in complete darkness and its so narrow that you won't be able to turn at all.//


===== A2: Guard Post =====
//The tunnel begins to open up into a large dug out room.  In the center you see the smoldering coals of what could have been a campfire.  Dimly lit on either side of the coals are 2 small heaps of earth.  The remainder of the room is in total darkness.//

A rock-fall trap is set up over the entrance DC15 perception to find. DC 10 dex save or take 2d6 bludgeoning dmg.  The kobolds on the northeastern wall try to set off the trap

4 regular kobolds and 2 kobold dragonshields in this area. They've recently put out the campfires, so this area is in total darkness except around the coals (Perception checks based on sight fail and disadvantage on attacks).
The 2 dragonshields are hiding behind the lumps of earth.  The rest are lining the north-eastern wall, ready to ambush the party.

**Developments**
If the kobolds escape, they warn those sleeping in areas 3 and 6 and try to harass the party while they're in the tunnels leading to areas 3 and light the moat leading to area 6.

**Loot**
5gp and a small silver whistle


===== A3: Sleeping Areas =====
//Numerous tiny beds of straw lie strewn about the perimeter if this room.  Severl kobolds lie sleeping, slightly illuminated by the dim glow of a campfire in the center of the room.//

There are escape tunnels in each of these areas.
8 kobolds in each room. 5 fight for a while, 3 try to escape immediately.

**Loot**
5gp and a small rudimentary trip string rigged with brass bells

===== A4: Hot Spring and Mushroom Farm =====
//This room is noticably warmer than the rest of the lair.  A small pool of blue-green water bubbles in the southwestern end. Focused near the pool and all along the walls and floors of the room are hundres of blue-green mushrooms.//

4 kobolds are picking mushrooms into baskets tucked under their arms.

**Loot**
mushrooms.  They have a minty flavor and are very nutritious.

===== A5: Incubation Tunnels =====
//The tunnels leading to this area squeeze tightly, crawling is extra slow.  You come upon a vertical wooden pole, stretching from the floor to the roof of the tunnel, blocking the path.  The pole connects at the roof with a single, long wooden plank that continues down the tunnel, ending in another vertical wooden pole.//

**Loot**
kobold eggs

===== A6: Throne Room =====
A mote of pitch runs the length of the tunnels leading to this area.  If any kobolds flee to here, they light the moat when they hear or see the party. 1d6 fire dmg when entering or starting turn on lit pitch
//This large room has a bon-fire roaring in the center providing dim light throughout the room.  Illuminated by the fire's dancling lights, on the far western wall sits a shrine in the shape of a dragon looming over a small hoard of treasure, glimmering in the fire light.  //

2 kobold scale sorcerors, 2 kobold dragonshields, and 1 older-looking kobold inventor with 16 AC and 30 HP are in this room.

**Developments**
If the players capture one of the kobolds or the kobolds surrender (last one standing will surrender), they tell the players that [[Venomfang]] a terrible green dragon that lives in the ruins to the northwest will come and avenge them we she doesn't receive her tribute on time.
  The kobolds have been using their tower setup to kill game and goblinoids.  They give the game and treasure looted from the goblinoids to Venomfang as tribute.
  They also try to lie and say there is more treasure in area 8 (The old treasure room before the cave-in).  There is really a water elemental.

**Loot**
Pile of precious gems and coins worth 80gp
Scroll of Protection
1 Potion of Fire Breath
1 set of Mithral scale mail (would need to be fitted by an armorer or smith)



===== A7: OMIT =====

===== A8: Caved In =====
If the players really try hard to go in, they find a water elemental
