====== 8.Crevasse ======
Created Wednesday 09 January 2019

//A cold breeze fills this large natural cavern, carrying with it the faint scent of decaying flesh.  A crevasse divides the cavern and is flanked by two rough stone columns that support the twenty-foot-high ceiling.  Two arched wooden bridges span the chasm.//

A crazy, chaotic evil nothic who would rather deal than fight lurks on the west end of the cavern.  The nothic was here before the redbrands, and made a deal with [[Iarno Albrek]] .  he guards this passage in exchange for treasure and food.  The nothic will betray Iarno for treasure or food.
The nothic speaks telepathicly and knows common.

The bridges are simple wooden planks with supporting beams.  DC 10 strength check to dislodge a support and crash the bridge. 
The south bridge is trapped to collapse in the center.  DC 15 investigation to discover trap.

**Developments**
If the players deal with the nothic, he threatens them for more treasure and/or food when they leave the complex.

**Loot**
The nothic's treasure hoarde is under the northern bridge. It contains 200 gp, a [[https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Augury#content|Scroll of Augury]], and a magical sword in a silver chased scabbard, [[Talon]].
