====== 5.Slave Pens ======
Created Wednesday 09 January 2019

//This long room is partitioned into three areas, with iron bars walling off the north and south.  Filthy straw lines the floors of those cells, the hinged doors of which are secured by chains and padlocks.  A pair of disheveled human women are held in the cell to the south, while a human boy is confined to the north.  All are dressed in plain grey tunics and have iron collars fitted around their necks.  A heap of discarded clothing is piled carelessly against the far wall.//

2 [[Redbrands]] guard this room.  If the party fights the skeletons in the [[4.Tresendar Crypts]], they hide behind the door and try to ambush the party.

The heap of clothing contains at least a dozen sets of clothing.

The cell doors require a DC 10 lockpicking check, DC 22 strength check, or key from [[Iarno Albrek]] or [[Mosk]] to open.

The 3 humans are [[:Mirna Dendrar|Mirna Dendrar]], her 22 year old daughter [[:Nisa Dendrar|Nisa Dendrar]], and 10 year old son [[:Nars Dendrar|Nars Dendrar]].  They were abducted after the [[Redbrands]] killed her husband [[Thel Dendrar]], and are being prepared for sale into slavery.
  The Dendrars know that the [[Redbrands]] boss is a human wizard, and they have "tall, furry monsters with big ears working for them" (bugbears).
  Mirna has nothing to offer as reward, but she tells the adventerurs where her family's heirloom, and emerald necklace is hidden in the [[Ruins of Thundertree]].
  When she was a young girl, her family had to flee Thundertree after undead overran the place.  They used to run an herb and alchemy shop and they left all their belongings there.

**Developments**
If the players save the Dendrars, they flee back to town and promise to help the adventerurs in any way they can.
