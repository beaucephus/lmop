====== 9.Guard Barracks ======
Created Wednesday 09 January 2019

//This barracks contains four roughly built wooden bunks, with heaped-up blankets and dirty dishes scattered about.  A strong smell of unwashed bodies and rotten meat fills the air.  Three tall, furry bugbears are lounging among the mess, barking orders at a sad little goblin that demeans itself for their amusement.  Your sudden appearance causes the goblin to faint.//

3 bugbears, one of which is [[Mosk]] and a goblin named [[Droop]] are here.
  [[Mosk]] wears a gemstone inlaid eyepatch even tho he has both eyes.
  If the party are wearing scarlett cloaks, the bugbears assume they are part of the [[Redbrands]]

**Developments**
If they players defeat the bugbears, [[Droop]] pleads with the party to let him live and escape, he'll do anything.

**What Droop knows**
Droop only knows the general location of [[Cragmaw Castle]]
Droop knows the bugbears and goblins patrolling the area would know where [[Cragmaw Castle]] is.

**What the bugbears know**
[[Mosk]] knows the location of [[Wave Echo Cave]].
All the bugbears know the location of [[Cragmaw Castle]]
DC15 intimidation to get the info

**Loot**
Mosk has 5 gp and wears an eyepatch of black leather set with semiprecious gemstones.  He also has a key that unlocks all the doors in the hideout.
