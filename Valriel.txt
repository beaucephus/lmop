====== Valriel ======
Created Thursday 30 May 2019

Valriel, also known as Val, is a servant knight to the master of strategy archdevil Bel. She's never known anything but combat and strife from the time she was a child. She doesn't know her father nor mother, but there was always Bel. 

Bel had adopted her, saw something in her, and raised her. Later, she discovered that her true parents belonged to a village that Bel had raided and that they were killed by his soldiers. It didn’t bother her much. She is a soldier now and understands the cost of war and duty more than anything else. Besides, she's only really ever known Bel as any sort of guardian. She worships his battle superiority and has become one of his most trusted Hell Knights. 

After hearing there was a commotion with giants in a region Tiamat once controlled Bel noticed this as an opportunity to take advantage of the chaos by bringing order with a single servant - Val. Val knows how to speak giant and has the fear potential to conquer an empire. He has sent her to bring order to this realm in his name while under the guise of bringing “peace” back to the land. Her true intention - to conqueror the entire region, push the giants back, and claim the land for Bel - will propel her to unknown heights and will be held close to her breast as her deepest secret.
