====== Neverdeath Graveyard ======
Created Wednesday 26 June 2019

Consisting of two wide, roughly square areas of the city, and surrounded by a wall of stone and wood, Neverdeath was the burial grounds of Neverwinter. It was named from a common blessing given over the dead. As long as the city remained in summer, it was believed that the dead would not turn into undead
