**history**
The Castle was heavily damaged by the eruption of Mount Hotenow in 1451 DR, and most of its towers and walls crumbled, as well as some of its interior rooms, halls and corridors. Being built on an strong foundation, however, the rest of the castle was left mostly intact.[2] As of 1489 DR, Castle Never was still in ruins
