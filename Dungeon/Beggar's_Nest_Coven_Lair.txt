Created Tuesday 10 September 2019

[[..\orphanage_hag_lair.jpg]]

===== 1. Entrance and Hound Area =====
2-3 Yeth Hounds guard this area that is laden with straw mattresses.
They are recently fed, and sleepily laze about
DC 5 stealth to sneak by unless they make a lot of noise.

===== 2 Removed from map =====

===== 3 Trash hole =====
This hallway leads in a downward slant towards a gaping 10 foot hole in the floor. The hole reeks of rot and decomposition.
Any character who approaches the hole to investigate must succed on a DC10 CON save or become incapacitated until they leave the hallway.

===== 4 Flesh mound's rounds =====
An animated round mound, 5 feet across, of flesh, muscle, and bone rolls a never-ending loop around this rectangular shaped corridor.
150 HP
A sleek line of blood, mucous, and pus slimes off the mound's round form as it rolls.
	Slippery terrain (Full-speed movement requires DC10 acrobatics check or fall prone)
The meatball attacks as a "overrun" attack. 
  2d6+4 damage and fall prone
Slashing damage causes the meatball to split in half like an ooze (each half gets half hp)

Any creature that falls prone in the area must succeed on a DC10 CON save or be incapacitated for the turn.


===== 5 Night Hag's Room =====
This room is decorated in dark blue and purple curtains, dotted with thousands of small sequins.
The firelight dancing of the sequins creates an ever shifting pattern like twinkling stars on the walls, floor, and ceiling.

The room is otherwise plainly furnished with a bed, table, a small hearth, fire, and cooking pot.
The bed is draped on all 4 sides with the same style curtains that line the walls.
On the table sits a large, wood-bounded book.
  The language is abyssal
  It documents the hag coven's operations in Neverwinter  [[:Beggar's Nest Coven]] and discloses the password to the door to area 6.

**Loot**
Black Ethel the night-hag lives here and keeps a small lock-box underneath her bed.
1 hag magic item

===== 6 Ritual Chamber =====
The hallway leading to this room is blocked by a heavy iron door with an intricate mechanical lock. An **Arcane Lock** spell has been cast on the door.
DC30 to open with arcane lock, DC20 otherwise. DC30 to force open.

The password can be found in area 5 if any player takes a moment to read Black Ethel's notes.

1 round after the players enter, [[:Auntie Hilda]] teleports into the room.
She summons the other hag sisters, have them show up at a balance-appropriate time.

Once all 3 are together, they toss around 2 magic totems that shields 2 of them.
The 2 that are holding the totem are restricted to casting cantrips, but are completely immune to damage.
__Their skin turns black and shiny like metal.__ Attacks and magical effects simply bounce off.
The totems must be attuned by a hag.

===== 7 Ritual Store House =====
This room is lined floor to ceiling with shelves.
The shelves are a mess with weird looking trinkets, torturous implements, sealed jars, and used bowls.

**Loot**
pick some hag-appropriate magic items
