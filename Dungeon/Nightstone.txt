Created Saturday 25 May 2019
@dungeon

Nightstone is a motte-and-bailey fortification built on the [[:Ardeep River]]

''After following the road for a few more miles, you hear the ringing of a bell. The sound grows louder as Nightstone comes into view. A river flows around the settlement forming a moat. The village itself is contained within a wooden palisade, inside of which you see the tops of a windmill, a tall steeple, and the high-pitched rooftops of several other buildings. Apart from the ringing of the bell, you detect no other activity in the village. The trail ends before a lowered draw-bridge that spans the moat on the western side of the village. Beyond the drawbridge, two stone watchtowers flank an open gap in the palisade.''
''South of the village and also surrounded by the river moat is a cone-shaped, flat-topped hill on which stands a stone keep enclosed by a wooden wall. The keep, which overlooks the village, has partially collapsed. A wooden bridge that once connected the keep to the village has also partially collapsed.''

Scattered all about the village are huge 500lb boulders and the wreckage wrought by their impacts. The impact craters and rubble make it seem as if the boulders had come from directly overhead.''
