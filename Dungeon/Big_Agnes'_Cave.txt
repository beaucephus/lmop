**Corpse flower** at the entrance.  __Large bulbous fern-like plant with the rotting and decomposing bodies of several humnaoids. 2 goblins, an orc, and a human.  All seem to be children.__

2-4 **yeth hounds** wander the network and chase down any indruders that linger too long
	The party hears a __ghastly baying sound ike that of a wounded dog or maybe a wailing man.__
	The baying gets progressively louder, until the pack bounds around a corner and pounces on the party.
	__The hounds stand 5-feet tall at the shoulder and must weigh 500lbs. __Characters without darkvision or light only see the glowing red of the eyes against the night-black fur. __The head has a human face, held up by a flexible horse-like neck connecting to the body of an abnormally large dog.__
