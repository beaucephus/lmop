If asked about what happened in [[Nightstone]]

Nightstone was bombarded by rocks dropped from a giant tower in the sky. The keep was cut off from the village when a giant rock tore away part of the bridge.
The villagers lowered the bridge and fled north.
North of Nightstone, about a mile away, are some bat caves. The villagers probably hid there.
Once the villagers left, 4 pale-skinned giants descended from the sky, uprooted the Nightstone ( [[Nightstone Megalith]] ) , and took it back to their tower. Then it left, drifting eastward.
[[Lady Velrosa Nandar]] was in the great hall when the roof collapsed. She was buried alive and died over the night. We couldn't get to her in time.
