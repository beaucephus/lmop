====== Blood-lust Potion ======
Created Wednesday 19 June 2019

__Viscous red potion dispersed with bits of animal hair.__

You can drink the bloodlust potion as an action. Doing so causes you to transform into a werewolf at dusk (see MM, page 207, for "Player Characters as Lycanthropes"), and temporarily alters your alignment to chaotic evil. This transformation lasts until the next dawn.
