Rod, rare (requires attunement)

__This 4 foot long adamantine rod wieghs over 100 pounds. The rod has two prongs at one end and a molded handle grip on the opposite end.__

The rod has 10 charges and regains 1d6 + 4 of its expended charges daily at dawn.
As an action, you can grasp the rod by the handle and expend 1 charge to cast the Locate Object spell from it.
When the rod is used to detect objects made of adamantine, such as fragments of the [[:Vonindod]] , its range increases to 10 miles.
