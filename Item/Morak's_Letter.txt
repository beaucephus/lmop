Moradin's favor, Friend

I heard you been lookin' fer a change. Well I got more change'n I kin what to do with.
Come see me at th' [[:Squawking Squirrel]] in [[Nightstone]] . I got good food, cheap rooms,
and a clan o' goblins raidin' the nearby caravans! The [[:Lady Velrosa Nandar]] been
promisin' 5 gold pieces bounty per goblin ear brought to the Nightstone keep.
I'd advise ye to come do the gittin' while the gittin's good!
