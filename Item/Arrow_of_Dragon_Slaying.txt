====== Arrow of Dragon Slaying ======
Created Monday 02 September 2019

If this arrow hits a dragon, the dragon must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking an extra 6d10 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much extra damage on a successful one.

Once the arrow deals its extra damage to a creature, it becomes a nonmagical arrow.
