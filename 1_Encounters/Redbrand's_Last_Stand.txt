====== Redbrand's Last Stand ======
Created Sunday 14 April 2019

//The road winds up the steep slope of a lesser mountain in the range.  The weather turns for the worse as the already chilly, thin mountain air fills with a snow flurry.  Near the summit, a bend in the road widens into a culdesac. Through the falling snow, you see a small camp with a lit fire.  Several shapes stand out amongst the flickering of the flame and snow.//

15 feet of dim light around the fire, othewise complete darkness.  Snow is light obscurity.
