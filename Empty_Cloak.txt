Special Traits
	Shadow Construction. Empty cloaks are designed with a delicate shadow construction. They burst into pieces, then dissipate into shadow, on a critical hit.
	Wrapping Embrace. Empty cloaks can share the same space as one Medium or smaller creature. The empty cloak has advantage on attack rolls against any creature in the same space with it.

Actions
		  Multiattack: An empty cloak makes 1 shadow slam and 1 shadow snare attack.

	Shadow Slam. Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft, one target. Hit: (2d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage.
	Shadow Snare. Ranged Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: Large or smaller creatures are restrained. To escape, the restrained creature or an adjacent ally must use an action to make a successful DC 14 Strength check. The shadow snare has 15 hit points and AC 12.

Appearance

Dark cloth of black and purple, stitched with silver and golden threads, this resembles a garment of elvish make. Smoke sometimes billows under the hood.
