Created Saturday 31 August 2019

The [[:Harpers]] maintain a network of teleportation circles throughout major cities in Faerun.

[[../harper teleportation network map.max.jpg]]

On their first use of the circles, the party meets [[:Krowen Valharrow]]
He is the resident arch mage who orchestrates and maintains the circles.
He knows the giant castes are in upheival all around and he knows the upheival poses a grave threat to the civilized peoples of the north.
He offers that if the party were to try and restore order among the giants, they may use his teleportation network.
He gives them a parchment with the relevant circles and their sigils.

===== Circle Locations =====

==== Everlund ====
This is the location where Krowen resides inside the [[:Moongleam Tower]] in [[:Everlund]]

==== Loudwater ====
Located in a 30-foot-square cellar underneath a tavern called the [[:Smiling Satyr]] in [[:Loudwater]]
Stairs lead up to the inside of a closed trunk that opens to a coat room near the back entrance of the Smiling Satyr
The proprieter, [[:Gharwin Umbryl]] is a Harper and monitors the circle entrance.

==== Mirabar ====
This circle is guarded by a shield dwarf mage disguised as a simple farmer in overalls and pitchfork.
Its situated inside the city walls in a Stable that serves as a front for Harper operations in [[:Mirabar]] .

==== Neverwinter ====
This circle is drawn in the attic of a creaky old three-story rowhouse that the Harpers use as an intelligence hub in the city.
Minding the circle is a confident byt socially awkward young woman named Sandyse Thuderquill.
The Harpers are training her to infiltrate the [[:Arcane Brotherhood]] in [[:Neverwinter]]

==== Waterdeep ====
The [[:Waterdeep]] circle is located inside a raised crypt in Waterdeep's large, walled cemetary, the City of the Dead.
The crypt has 2 levels. The name "Myrna" is inscribed above its entrance, which is sealed with an arcane lock spell.
The topmost level is the crypt itself which contains a stone sarcophagus watched over by a shield guardian that is trained to lift the lid when someone speaks the name "Myrna" outloud. 
The sarcophagus contains a stone staircase leading down to a brightly-lit room where a whisp of a woman, [[Thestryl Mellardin]] lives and studies.

==== Yartar ====
The [[:Yartar]] circle is a run-down, dillapidated villa in the heart of the city.
A cantakorous old mage, [[:Kolbaz]] , dwells in the villa and casts a Hallucinatory Terrain spell on the villa every morning at high-sun.
The spell creates an illusion that the iron-bar-walled villa looks as it did in its hay-day.
In reality the villa is overgrown, and an overgrown patio area in the back conceals the teleportation circle.
